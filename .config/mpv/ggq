       mmppvv  is  a media player based on MPlayer and mplayer2. It supports a wide variety of video file
       formats, audio and video codecs, and subtitle types. Special input URL types are  available  to
       read input from a variety of sources other than disk files. Depending on platform, a variety of
       different video and audio output methods are supported.

       Usage examples to get you started quickly can be found at the end of this man page.

       mpv has a fully configurable, command-driven control layer which  allows  you  to  control  mpv
       using keyboard, mouse, or remote control (there is no LIRC support - configure remotes as input
       devices instead).

       See the ----iinnppuutt-- options for ways to customize it.

UUSSAAGGEE
       Command line arguments starting with -- are interpreted as options, everything else as filenames
       or URLs. All options except _f_l_a_g options (or choice options which include yyeess) require a param‐
       eter in the form ----ooppttiioonn==vvaalluuee.

       One  exception  is the lone -- (without anything else), which means media data will be read from
       stdin. Also, ---- (without anything else) will make the player interpret all following  arguments
       as filenames, even if they start with --. (To play a file named --, you need to use ..//--.)

       Every  _f_l_a_g  option has a _n_o_-_f_l_a_g counterpart, e.g. the opposite of the ----ffss option is ----nnoo--ffss.
       ----ffss==yyeess is same as ----ffss, ----ffss==nnoo is the same as ----nnoo--ffss.

       If an option is marked as _(_X_X_X _o_n_l_y_), it will only work in combination with the _X_X_X  option  or
       if _X_X_X is compiled in.

       The  ----ooppttiioonn==vvaalluuee  syntax is not strictly enforced, and the alternative legacy syntax --ooppttiioonn
       vvaalluuee and ----ooppttiioonn vvaalluuee will also work. This is mostly  for compatibility with MPlayer.  Using
       these should be avoided. Their semantics can change any time in the future.

       For  example, the alternative syntax will consider an argument following the option a filename.
       mmppvv --ffss nnoo will attempt to play a file named nnoo, because ----ffss is a flag option that requires no
       parameter.  If  an option changes and its parameter becomes optional, then a command line using
       the alternative syntax will break.

       Currently, the parser makes no difference whether an option starts with ---- or a single --.  This
       might also change in the future, and ----ooppttiioonn vvaalluuee might always interpret vvaalluuee as filename in
       order to reduce ambiguities.

       Keep in mind that the shell will partially parse and mangle the arguments you pass to mpv.  For
       example, you might need to quote or escape options and filenames:
          mmppvv ""ffiilleennaammee wwiitthh ssppaacceess..mmkkvv"" ----ttiittllee==""wwiinnddooww ttiittllee""

       It gets more complicated if the suboption parser is involved. The suboption parser puts several
       options into a single string, and passes them to a component at once, instead of using multiple
       options on the level of the command line.

       The suboption parser can quote strings with "" and [[......]].  Additionally, there is a special form
       of quoting with %%nn%% described below.

       For example, assume the hypothetical ffoooo filter can take multiple options:
          mmppvv tteesstt..mmkkvv ----vvff==ffoooo::ooppttiioonn11==vvaalluuee11::ooppttiioonn22::ooppttiioonn33==vvaalluuee33,,bbaarr

       This passes  ooppttiioonn11  and  ooppttiioonn33  to  the  ffoooo  filter,  with  ooppttiioonn22  as  flag  (implicitly
       ooppttiioonn22==yyeess), and adds a bbaarr filter after that. If an option contains spaces or characters like
       ,, or ::, you need to quote them:
          mmppvv ''----vvff==ffoooo::ooppttiioonn11==""ooppttiioonn vvaalluuee wwiitthh ssppaacceess"",,bbaarr''

       Shells may actually strip some quotes from the string passed to the commandline, so the example
       quotes the string twice, ensuring that mpv receives the "" quotes.

       The  [[......]]  form of quotes wraps everything between [[ and ]]. It's useful with shells that don't
       interpret these characters in the middle of an argument (like bash). These quotes are  balanced
       (since  mpv 0.9.0): the [[ and ]] nest, and the quote terminates on the last ]] that has no match‐
       ing [[ within the string. (For example, [[aa[[bb]]cc]] results in aa[[bb]]cc.)

       The fixed-length quoting syntax is intended for use with external scripts and programs.

       It is started with %% and has the following format:

          %n%string_of_length_n

          Examples

                 mmppvv ''----vvff==ffoooo::ooppttiioonn11==%%1111%%qquuootteedd tteexxtt'' tteesstt..aavvii

                 Or in a script:

                 mmppvv ----vvff==ffoooo::ooppttiioonn11==%%``eexxpprr lleennggtthh ""$$NNAAMMEE""``%%""$$NNAAMMEE"" tteesstt..aavvii

       Suboptions passed to the client API are also subject to escaping. Using mmppvv__sseett__ooppttiioonn__ssttrriinngg(())
       is  exactly  like  passing ----nnaammee==ddaattaa to the command line (but without shell processing of the
       string). Some options support passing values in a more structured way instead of flat  strings,
       and  can  avoid  the  suboption parsing mess. For example, ----vvff supports MMPPVV__FFOORRMMAATT__NNOODDEE, which
       lets you pass suboptions as a nested data structure of maps and arrays.

   PPaatthhss
       Some care must be taken when passing arbitrary paths and filenames to mpv. For  example,  paths
       starting  with -- will be interpreted as options. Likewise, if a path contains the sequence ::////,
       the string before that might be interpreted as protocol prefix, even though :://// can be part  of
       a  legal  UNIX  path.  To avoid problems with arbitrary paths, you should be sure that absolute
       paths passed to mpv start with //, and prefix relative paths with ..//.

       Using the ffiillee:://// pseudo-protocol is discouraged, because it involves  strange  URL  unescaping
       rules.

       The  name  --  itself  is  interpreted as stdin, and will cause mpv to disable console controls.
       (Which makes it suitable for playing data piped to stdin.)

       The special argument ---- can be used to stop mpv from interpreting the  following  arguments  as
       options.

       When  using the client API, you should strictly avoid using mmppvv__ccoommmmaanndd__ssttrriinngg for invoking the
       llooaaddffiillee command, and instead prefer e.g. mmppvv__ccoommmmaanndd to avoid the need for filename escaping.

       For paths passed to suboptions, the situation is further complicated by the need to escape spe‐
       cial  characters. To work this around, the path can be additionally wrapped in the fixed-length
       syntax, e.g. %%nn%%ssttrriinngg__ooff__lleennggtthh__nn (see above).

       Some mpv options interpret paths starting with ~~. Currently, the prefix ~~~~// expands to the  mpv
       configuration  directory  (usually  ~~//..ccoonnffiigg//mmppvv//).   ~~// expands to the user's home directory.
       (The trailing // is always required.) There are the following paths as well:

                             ┌─────────────┬────────────────────────────────────┐
                             │Name         │ Meaning                            │

       When  playing  multiple  files, any option given on the command line usually affects all files.
       Example:

          mpv --a file1.mkv --b file2.mkv --c

       (This is different from MPlayer and mplayer2.)

       Also, if any option is changed at runtime (via input commands), they are not reset when  a  new
       file is played.

       Sometimes,  it is useful to change options per-file. This can be achieved by adding the special
       per-file markers ----{{ and ----}}. (Note that you must escape these on some shells.) Example:

          mpv --a file1.mkv --b --\{ --c file2.mkv --d file3.mkv --e --\} file4.mkv --f

       Additionally, any file-local option changed at runtime is reset when  the  current  file  stops
       playing.  If  option ----cc is changed during playback of ffiillee22..mmkkvv, it is reset when advancing to
       ffiillee33..mmkkvv. This only affects file-local options. The option ----aa is never reset here.

   LLiisstt OOppttiioonnss
       Some options which store lists of option values can have action suffixes. For example, you  can
       set  a  ,,-separated list of filters with ----vvff, but the option also allows you to append filters
       with ----vvff--aappppeenndd.

       Options for filenames do not use ,, as separator, but :: (Unix) or ;; (Windows).

       Although some operations allow specifying multiple ,,-separated items, using  this  is  strongly
       discouraged and deprecated, except for --sseett.

       Without suffix, the action taken is normally --sseett.

       Some  options  (like ----ssuubb--ffiillee, ----aauuddiioo--ffiillee, ----ggllssll--sshhaaddeerr) are aliases for the proper option
       with --aappppeenndd action. For example, ----ssuubb--ffiillee is an alias for ----ssuubb--ffiilleess--aappppeenndd.

       Some options only support a subset of the above.

       Options of this type can be changed at runtime using the cchhaannggee--lliisstt command, which  takes  the
       suffix as separate operation parameter.

   PPllaayyiinngg DDVVDDss
       DVDs  can  be  played  with  the ddvvdd::////[[ttiittllee]] syntax. The optional title specifier is a number
       which selects between separate video streams on the DVD. If no title is given (ddvvdd::////) then the
       longest title is selected automatically by the library. This is usually what you want. mpv does
       not support DVD menus.

       DVDs which have been copied on to a hard drive or other mounted filesystem (by  e.g.  the  ddvvdd‐‐
       bbaacckkuupp  tool)  are  accommodated  by  specifying the path to the local copy: ----ddvvdd--ddeevviiccee==PPAATTHH.
       Alternatively, running mmppvv PPAATTHH should auto-detect a DVD directory tree and  play  the  longest
       title.

          DVD library choices

          mpv  uses  a different default DVD library than MPlayer. MPlayer uses libdvdread by default,
          and mpv uses libdvdnav by default.  Both libraries are developed in parallel, but  libdvdnav
          is  intended  to support more sophisticated DVD features such as menus and multi-angle play‐
          back. mpv uses libdvdnav for files specified as either ddvvdd::////......  or  ddvvddnnaavv::////.......  To  use
          libdvdread,  which  will  produce behavior more like MPlayer, specify ddvvddrreeaadd::////...... instead.
          Some users have experienced problems when using libdvdnav, in which playback gets stuck in a
          DVD  menu  stream.  These  problems  are  reported  to go away when auto-selecting the title
          (ddvvdd:://// rather than ddvvdd::////11) or when using libdvdread (e.g.  ddvvddrreeaadd::////00).  There  are  also
          outstanding bugs in libdvdnav with seeking backwards and forwards in a video stream. Specify
          ddvvddrreeaadd::////...... to fix such problems.

          DVD subtitles

          DVDs use image-based subtitles. Image subtitles are implemented as  a  bitmap  video  stream
          which  can  be  superimposed  over  the  main  movie. mpv's subtitle styling and positioning
          options and keyboard shortcuts generally do not work with image-based subtitles.  Exceptions
          include options like ----ssttrreettcchh--ddvvdd--ssuubbss and ----ssttrreettcchh--iimmaaggee--ssuubbss--ttoo--ssccrreeeenn.

       You can put all of the options in configuration files which will be read every time mpv is run.
       The system-wide configuration file 'mpv.conf' is in your configuration directory (e.g. //eettcc//mmppvv
       or  //uussrr//llooccaall//eettcc//mmppvv), the user-specific one is ~~//..ccoonnffiigg//mmppvv//mmppvv..ccoonnff. For details and plat‐
       form specifics (in particular Windows paths) see the _F_I_L_E_S section.

       User-specific options override system-wide options and options given on the command line  over‐
       ride  either.  The  syntax  of the configuration files is ooppttiioonn==vvaalluuee. Everything after a _# is
       considered a comment. Options that work without values can be enabled by setting  them  to  _y_e_s
       and disabled by setting them to _n_o. Even suboptions can be specified in this way.

          Example configuration file

              # Use GPU-accelerated video output by default.
              vo=gpu
              # Use quotes for text that can contain spaces:
              status-msg="Time: ${time-pos}"

       This  is done like with command line options. The shell is not involved here, but option values
       still need to be quoted as a whole if it contains certain  characters  like  spaces.  A  config
       entry  can  be  quoted  with "", as well as with the fixed-length syntax (%%nn%%) mentioned before.
       This is like passing the exact contents of the quoted string as command  line  option.  C-style
       escapes  are currently _not_ interpreted on this level, although some options do this manually.
       (This is a mess and should probably be changed at some point.)

       You can also write file-specific configuration files. If you wish to have a configuration  file
       for  a  file  called  'video.avi',  create a file named 'video.avi.conf' with the file-specific
       options in it and put it in ~~//..ccoonnffiigg//mmppvv//. You can also put the configuration file in the same
       directory  as  the  file  to  be  played. Both require you to set the ----uussee--ffiilleeddiirr--ccoonnff option
       (either on the command line or in your global config file). If  a  file-specific  configuration
       file  is  found  in  the  same directory, no file-specific configuration is loaded from ~~//..ccoonn‐‐
       ffiigg//mmppvv. In addition, the ----uussee--ffiilleeddiirr--ccoonnff option  enables  directory-specific  configuration
       files.  For this, mpv first tries to load a mpv.conf from the same directory as the file played
       and then tries to load any file-specific configuration.

   PPrrooffiilleess
       To ease working with different configurations, profiles can be  defined  in  the  configuration
       files.  A  profile  starts  with  its name in square brackets, e.g. [[mmyy--pprrooffiillee]]. All following
       options will be part of the profile. A description (shown by  ----pprrooffiillee==hheellpp)  can  be  defined
       with  the  pprrooffiillee--ddeesscc  option.  To end the profile, start another one or use the profile name
       ddeeffaauulltt to continue with normal options.

       You can list profiles with ----pprrooffiillee==hheellpp, and show the contents of a profile with  ----sshhooww--pprroo‐‐
       ffiillee==<<nnaammee>>  (replace  <<nnaammee>>  with the profile name). You can apply profiles on start with the
       ----pprrooffiillee==<<nnaammee>> option, or at runtime with the aappppllyy--pprrooffiillee <<nnaammee>> command.

          Example mpv config file with profiles

              # normal top-level option
              fullscreen=yes

              # a profile that can be enabled with --profile=big-cache
              [big-cache]
              cache=123400
              demuxer-readahead-secs=20

              [slow]
              profile-desc="some profile name"
              # reference a builtin profile
              profile=gpu-hq

              [fast]
              vo=vdpau

              # using a profile again extends it

              framedrop=no

       Some profiles are loaded automatically. The following example demonstrates this:

       The profile name follows the schema ttyyppee..nnaammee, where type can be pprroottooccooll for the  input/output
       protocol in use (see ----lliisstt--pprroottooccoollss), and eexxtteennssiioonn for the extension of the path of the cur‐
       rently played file (_n_o_t the file format).

       This feature is very limited, and there are no other auto profiles.

TTAAKKIINNGG SSCCRREEEENNSSHHOOTTSS
       Screenshots of the currently played file can be taken using the 'screenshot'  input  mode  com‐
       mand, which is by default bound to the ss key. Files named mmppvv--sshhoottNNNNNNNN..jjppgg will be saved in the
       working directory, using the first  available  number  -  no  files  will  be  overwritten.  In
       pseudo-GUI mode, the screenshot will be saved somewhere else. See _P_S_E_U_D_O _G_U_I _M_O_D_E.

       A  screenshot  will  usually contain the unscaled video contents at the end of the video filter
       chain and subtitles. By default, SS takes screenshots without subtitles, while ss includes subti‐
       tles.

       Unlike  with  MPlayer,  the  ssccrreeeennsshhoott  video  filter  is  not required. This filter was never
       required in mpv, and has been removed.

TTEERRMMIINNAALL SSTTAATTUUSS LLIINNEE
       During playback, mpv shows the playback status on the terminal. It looks  like  something  like
       this:
          AAVV:: 0000::0033::1122 // 0000::2244::2255 ((1133%%)) AA--VV:: --00..000000

       The status line can be overridden with the ----tteerrmm--ssttaattuuss--mmssgg option.

       The  following  is a list of things that can show up in the status line. Input properties, that
       can be used to get the same information manually, are also listed.

       · AAVV:: or VV:: (video only) or AA:: (audio only)

       · The current time position in HHHH::MMMM::SSSS format (ppllaayybbaacckk--ttiimmee property)

       · The total file duration (absent if unknown) (lleennggtthh property)

       · Playback speed, e.g. `` x2.0``. Only visible  if  the  speed  is  not  normal.  This  is  the
         user-requested  speed,  and  not  the  actual speed  (usually they should be the same, unless
         playback is too slow). (ssppeeeedd property.)

       · Playback percentage, e.g. ((1133%%)). How much of the file has been played.   Normally  calculated
         out of playback position and duration, but can fallback to other methods (like byte position)
         if these are not available.  (ppeerrcceenntt--ppooss property.)

       · The audio/video sync as AA--VV::  00..000000. This is the difference between  audio  and  video  time.
         Normally it should be 0 or close to 0. If it's growing, it might indicate a playback problem.
         (aavvssyynncc property.)

       · Total A/V sync change, e.g. cctt:: --00..441177. Normally invisible. Can show up  if  there  is  audio
         "missing",  or  not  enough  frames  can  be  dropped.  Usually this will indicate a problem.
         (ttoottaall--aavvssyynncc--cchhaannggee property.)

       · Encoding state in {{......}}, only shown in encoding mode.

       · Display sync state. If display sync is active (ddiissppllaayy--ssyynncc--aaccttiivvee property), this shows  DDSS::
         22..550000//1133,  where  the first number is average number of vsyncs per video frame (e.g. 2.5 when
         playing 24Hz videos on 60Hz screens), which might jitter if the ratio doesn't round  off,  or
         there  are mistimed frames (vvssyynncc--rraattiioo), and the second number of estimated number of vsyncs
         which took too long (vvoo--ddeellaayyeedd--ffrraammee--ccoouunntt property). The latter is  a  heuristic,  as  it's
         generally not possible to determine this with certainty.

       · Dropped  frames,  e.g. DDrrooppppeedd:: 44. Shows up only if the count is not 0. Can grow if the video
         framerate is higher than that of the display, or if video rendering is too slow. May also  be
         incremented   on  "hiccups"  and  when  the  video  frame  couldn't  be  displayed  on  time.
         (vvoo--ddrroopp--ffrraammee--ccoouunntt property.)  If the decoder drops frames, the number  of  decoder-dropped
         frames  is appended to the display as well, e.g.: DDrrooppppeedd:: 44//3344. This happens only if decoder
         frame dropping is enabled with the ----ffrraammeeddrroopp options.  (ddrroopp--ffrraammee--ccoouunntt property.)

       · Cache state, e.g. CCaacchhee::  22ss++113344KKBB. Visible if the stream cache is enabled.  The first  value
         shows  the amount of video buffered in the demuxer in seconds, the second value shows the sum
         of the demuxer forward cache size and the _a_d_d_i_t_i_o_n_a_l data buffered in  the  stream  cache  in
         kilobytes.  (ddeemmuuxxeerr--ccaacchhee--dduurraattiioonn, ddeemmuuxxeerr--ccaacchhee--ssttaattee, ccaacchhee--uusseedd properties.)

LLOOWW LLAATTEENNCCYY PPLLAAYYBBAACCKK
       mpv is optimized for normal video playback, meaning it actually tries to buffer as much data as
       it seems to make sense. This will increase  latency.  Reducing  latency  is  possible  only  by
       specifically disabling features which increase latency.

       The  builtin  llooww--llaatteennccyy  profile tries to apply some of the options which can reduce latency.
       You can use  ----pprrooffiillee==llooww--llaatteennccyy to apply all  of  them.  You  can  list  the  contents  with
       ----sshhooww--pprrooffiillee==llooww--llaatteennccyy  (some  of  the  options are quite obscure, and may change every mpv
       release).

       Be aware that some of the options can reduce playback quality.

       Most latency is actually caused by inconvenient timing behavior.  You  can  disable  this  with
       ----uunnttiimmeedd,  but  it will likely break, unless the stream has no audio, and the input feeds data
       to the player at a constant rate.

       Another common problem is with MJPEG streams. These do not signal the correct framerate.  Using
       ----uunnttiimmeedd or ----nnoo--ccoorrrreecctt--ppttss ----ffppss==6600 might help.

       For  livestreams,  data  can build up due to pausing the stream, due to slightly lower playback
       rate, or "buffering" pauses. If the demuxer cache is enabled, these can  be  skipped  manually.
       The  experimental  ddrroopp--bbuuffffeerrss  command  can be used to discard any buffered data, though it's
       very disruptive.

       In some cases, manually tuning TCP buffer sizes and such can help to reduce latency.

       Additional options that can be tried:

       · ----ooppeennggll--ggllffiinniisshh==yyeess, can reduce buffering in the graphics driver

       · ----ooppeennggll--sswwaappiinntteerrvvaall==00, same

       · ----vvoo==xxvv, same

       · without audio ----ffrraammeeddrroopp==nnoo ----ssppeeeedd==11..0011 may help for live sources (results can be mixed)

       hhttttpp::////......, hhttttppss::////, ...
          Many network protocols are supported, but the protocol prefix must always be specified.  mpv
          will  never  attempt  to  guess whether a filename is actually a network address. A protocol
          prefix is always required.

          Note that not all prefixes are documented here. Undocumented prefixes are either aliases  to
          documented  protocols,  or  are just redirections to protocols implemented and documented in
          FFmpeg.

          ddaattaa:: is supported in FFmpeg (not in Libav), but needs to be in the format ddaattaa::////. This  is
          done to avoid ambiguity with filenames. You can also prefix it with llaavvff:://// or ffffmmppeegg::////.

       yyttddll::////......
          By  default,  the youtube-dl hook script (enabled by default for mpv CLI) only looks at http
          URLs. Prefixing an URL with yyttddll:://// forces it to be always processed by the script. This can
          also be used to invoke special youtube-dl functionality like playing a video by ID or invok‐
          ing search.

          Keep in mind that you can't pass youtube-dl command line options by this, and  you  have  to
          use ----yyttddll--rraaww--ooppttiioonnss instead.

       --
          Play data from stdin.

       ssmmbb::////PPAATTHH
          Play a path from  Samba share.

          Play  a  Blu-ray disc. Since libbluray 1.0.1, you can read from ISO files by passing them to
          ----bblluurraayy--ddeevviiccee.

          ttiittllee can be: lloonnggeesstt or ffiirrsstt (selects the default playlist); mmppllss//<<nnuummbbeerr>> (selects  <num‐
          ber>.mpls  playlist);  <<nnuummbbeerr>>  (select  playlist  with  the same index). mpv will list the
          available playlists on loading.

          bblluurraayy:://// is an alias.

       ddvvdd::////[[ttiittllee||[[ssttaarrttttiittllee]]--eennddttiittllee]][[//ddeevviiccee]] ----ddvvdd--ddeevviiccee==PPAATTHH
          Play a DVD. DVD menus are not supported.  If  no  title  is  given,  the  longest  title  is
          auto-selected.

          ddvvddnnaavv:://// is an old alias for ddvvdd:://// and does exactly the same thing.

       ddvvddrreeaadd::////......::
          Play  a  DVD using the old libdvdread code. This is what MPlayer and older mpv versions used
          for ddvvdd::////. Use is discouraged. It's provided only for compatibility and for transition, and
          to work around outstanding dvdnav bugs (see "DVD library choices" above).

          Play CD.

       llaavvff::////......
          Access any FFmpeg/Libav libavformat protocol. Basically, this passed the string after the ////
          directly to libavformat.

       aavv::////ttyyppee::ooppttiioonnss
          This is intended for using libavdevice inputs. ttyyppee is the  libavdevice  demuxer  name,  and
          ooppttiioonnss is the (pseudo-)filename passed to the demuxer.

          For  example,  mmppvv  aavv::////llaavvffii::mmaannddeellbbrroott  makes  use of the libavfilter wrapper included in
          libavdevice, and will use the mmaannddeellbbrroott source filter to generate input data.

          aavvddeevviiccee:://// is an alias.

       ffiillee::////PPAATTHH
          A local path as URL. Might be useful in some special use-cases. Note that PPAATTHH itself should
          start with a third // to make the path an absolute path.

       aappppeennddiinngg::////PPAATTHH
          Play  a  local file, but assume it's being appended to. This is useful for example for files
          that are currently being downloaded to disk. This will block  playback,  and  stop  playback
          only if no new data was appended after a timeout of about 2 seconds.

          Using  this  is  still  a  bit of a bad idea, because there is no way to detect if a file is
          actually being appended, or if it's still written. If you're trying to play the   output  of
          some  program,  consider  using a pipe (ssoommeetthhiinngg || mmppvv --). If it really has to be a file on
          disk, use tail to make it wait forever, e.g. ttaaiill --ff --cc ++00 ffiillee..mmkkvv || mmppvv --.

       ffdd::////112233
          Read data from the given file descriptor (for example 123). This is similar to  piping  data
          to stdin via --, but can use an arbitrary file descriptor.  mpv may modify some file descrip‐
          tor properties when the stream layer "opens" it.

       ffddcclloossee::////112233
          Like ffdd::////, but the file descriptor is closed after use. When using this you need to  ensure
          that the same fd URL will only be used once.

       eeddll::////[[eeddll ssppeecciiffiiccaattiioonn aass iinn eeddll--mmppvv..rrsstt]]
          Stitch together parts of multiple files and play them.

       nnuullll::////
          Simulate  an  empty file. If opened for writing, it will discard all data.  The nnuullll demuxer
          will specifically pass autoprobing if this protocol is used (while  it's  not  automatically
          invoked for empty files).

       mmeemmoorryy::////ddaattaa
          Use the ddaattaa part as source data.

       hheexx::////ddaattaa
          Like mmeemmoorryy::////, but the string is interpreted as hexdump.

PPSSEEUUDDOO GGUUII MMOODDEE
       mpv has no official GUI, other than the OSC (_O_N _S_C_R_E_E_N _C_O_N_T_R_O_L_L_E_R), which is not a full GUI and
       is not meant to be. However, to compensate for the lack of expected GUI behavior, mpv  will  in
       some cases start with some settings changed to behave slightly more like a GUI mode.

       Currently this happens only in the following cases:

       · if  started using the mmppvv..ddeesskkttoopp file on Linux (e.g. started from menus or file associations
         provided by desktop environments)

       · if started from explorer.exe on Windows (technically, if it was started on Windows,  and  all
         of the stdout/stderr/stdin handles are unset)

       · started out of the bundle on OSX

       · if you manually use ----ppllaayyeerr--ooppeerraattiioonn--mmooddee==ppsseeuuddoo--gguuii on the command line

       This  mode  applies  options  from  the  builtin  profile bbuuiillttiinn--ppsseeuuddoo--gguuii, but only if these
       haven't been set in the user's config file or on the command  line.   Also,  for  compatibility
       with  the  old  pseudo-gui behavior, the options in the ppsseeuuddoo--gguuii profile are applied uncondi‐
       tionally. In addition, the profile makes sure to enable the pseudo-GUI  mode,  so  that  ----pprroo‐‐
       ffiillee==ppsseeuuddoo--gguuii  works  like  in older mpv releases. The profiles are currently defined as fol‐
       lows:

          [builtin-pseudo-gui]
          terminal=no
          force-window=yes
          idle=once
          screenshot-directory=~~desktop/
          [pseudo-gui]
          player-operation-mode=pseudo-gui

       WWAARRNNIINNGG::
          Currently, you can extend the ppsseeuuddoo--gguuii profile in the config file the normal way. This  is
          deprecated. In future mpv releases, the behavior might change, and not apply your additional
          settings, and/or use a different profile name.

              If  video is disabled, mpv will try to download the audio only if media is streamed with
              youtube-dl, because it saves bandwidth. This is  done  by  setting  the  ytdl_format  to
              "bestaudio/best" in the ytdl_hook.lua script.

       ----eeddiittiioonn==<<IIDD||aauuttoo>>
              (Matroska  files  only)  Specify  the  edition  (set of chapters) to use, where 0 is the
              first. If set to aauuttoo (the default), mpv will choose the first  edition  declared  as  a
              default, or if there is no default, the first edition defined.

              Enable  the  default  track  auto-selection  (default: yes). Enabling this will make the
              player select streams according to ----aaiidd, ----aallaanngg, and others. If  it  is  disabled,  no
              tracks  are  selected.  In addition, the player will not exit if no tracks are selected,
              and wait instead (this wait mode is similar to pausing, but  the  pause  option  is  not
              set).

              This  is  useful with ----llaavvffii--ccoommpplleexx: you can start playback in this mode, and then set
              select tracks at runtime by setting the filter graph.  Note that if  ----llaavvffii--ccoommpplleexx  is
              set before playback is started, the referenced tracks are always selected.

              Seek to given time position.

              The  general format for absolute times is [[[[hhhh::]]mmmm::]]ssss[[..mmss]]. If the time is given with a
              prefix of ++ or --, the seek is relative from the start or end of  the  file.  (Since  mpv
              0.14, the start of the file is always considered 0.)

              pppp%% seeks to percent position pp (0-100).

              ##cc seeks to chapter number c. (Chapters start from 1.)

              nnoonnee resets any previously set option (useful for libmpv).

                        onds, and exits.

                        Plays chapters 2 and 3, and exits.

       ----eenndd==<<rreellaattiivvee ttiimmee>>
              Stop at given time. Use ----lleennggtthh if the time should be relative to ----ssttaarrtt. See  ----ssttaarrtt
              for valid option values and examples.

       ----lleennggtthh==<<rreellaattiivvee ttiimmee>>
              Stop after a given time relative to the start time.  See ----ssttaarrtt for valid option values
              and examples.

              If both ----eenndd and ----lleennggtthh are provided, playback will stop when it  reaches  either  of
              the two endpoints.

              Whether to move the file start time to 0000::0000::0000 (default: yes). This is less awkward for
              files which start at a random timestamp, such as transport streams. On the  other  hand,
              if there are timestamp resets, the resulting behavior can be rather weird. For this rea‐
              son, and in case you are actually interested in the real timestamps, this  behavior  can
              be disabled with nnoo.

       ----ssppeeeedd==<<00..0011--110000>>

              Set which file on the internal playlist to start playback with. The index is an integer,
              with 0 meaning the first file. The value aauuttoo means that the selection of the  entry  to
              play  is  left  to  the  playback resume mechanism (default). If an entry with the given
              index doesn't exist, the behavior is unspecified and might change  in  future  mpv  ver‐
              sions.  The  same  applies  if the playlist contains further playlists (don't expect any
              reasonable behavior). Passing a playlist file to  mpv  should  work  with  this  option,
              though.  E.g.  mmppvv  ppllaayylliisstt..mm33uu  ----ppllaayylliisstt--ssttaarrtt==112233 will work as expected, as long as
              ppllaayylliisstt..mm33uu does not link to further playlists.

              The value nnoo is a deprecated alias for aauuttoo.

       ----ppllaayylliisstt==<<ffiilleennaammee>>
              Play files according to a playlist file (Supports some common formats. If no  format  is
              detected,  it  will  be  treated as list of files, separated by newline characters. Note
              that XML playlist formats are not supported.)

              You can play playlists directly and without this option, however, this  option  disables
              any  security  mechanisms  that might be in place. You may also need this option to load
              plaintext files as playlist.

              WWAARRNNIINNGG::
                 The way mpv uses playlist files via ----ppllaayylliisstt is not safe against  maliciously  con‐
                 structed  files.  Such files may trigger harmful actions.  This has been the case for
                 all mpv and MPlayer versions, but unfortunately this fact  was  not  well  documented
                 earlier,  and  some  people  have even misguidedly recommended use of ----ppllaayylliisstt with
                 untrusted sources. Do NOT use ----ppllaayylliisstt with random internet sources or files you do
                 not trust!

                 Playlist can contain entries using other protocols, such as local files, or (most se‐
                 verely), special protocols like aavvddeevviiccee::////, which are inherently unsafe.

              Threshold for merging almost consecutive ordered chapter parts in milliseconds (default:
              100).  Some Matroska files with ordered chapters have inaccurate chapter end timestamps,
              causing a small gap between the end of one chapter and the start of the  next  one  when
              they  should  match.   If  the end of one playback part is less than the given threshold
              away from the start of the next one then keep playing video normally  over  the  chapter
              change instead of doing a seek.

              Distance in seconds from the beginning of a chapter within which a backward chapter seek
              will go to the previous chapter (default: 5.0). Past this threshold, a backward  chapter
              seek  will  go  to  the beginning of the current chapter instead. A negative value means
              always go back to the previous chapter.

       ----hhrr--sseeeekk==<<nnoo||aabbssoolluuttee||yyeess>>
              Select when to use precise seeks that are not limited to keyframes. Such  seeks  require
              decoding video from the previous keyframe up to the target position and so can take some
              time depending on decoding performance. For some video formats, precise seeks  are  dis‐
              abled.  This  option  selects  the  default  choice  to use for seeks; it is possible to
              explicitly override that default in the definition of key bindings  and  in  input  com‐
              mands.

              nnoo     Never use precise seeks.

              aabbssoolluuttee
                     Use  precise  seeks if the seek is to an absolute position in the file, such as a
                     chapter seek, but not for relative seeks like the default behavior of arrow  keys
                     (default).

              yyeess    Use precise seeks whenever possible.

              This  option exists to work around failures to do precise seeks (as in ----hhrr--sseeeekk) caused
              by bugs or limitations in the demuxers for some file formats. Some demuxers fail to seek
              to  a  keyframe before the given target position, going to a later position instead. The
              value of this option is subtracted from the time stamp given to the  demuxer.  Thus,  if
              you  set  this  option to 1.5 and try to do a precise seek to 60 seconds, the demuxer is
              told to seek to time 58.5, which hopefully reduces the chance that it  erroneously  goes
              to  some time later than 60 seconds. The downside of setting this option is that precise
              seeks become slower, as video between the earlier demuxer position and the  real  target
              may be unnecessarily decoded.

              Allow  the video decoder to drop frames during seek, if these frames are before the seek
              target. If this is enabled, precise seeking can be faster, but  if  you're  using  video
              filters  which modify timestamps or add new frames, it can lead to precise seeking skip‐
              ping the target frame. This e.g. can break  frame  backstepping  when  deinterlacing  is
              enabled.

       ----iinnddeexx==<<mmooddee>>
              Controls how to seek in files. Note that if the index is missing from a file, it will be
              built on the fly by default, so you don't need to change this. But it  might  help  with
              some broken files.

              links on the other hand are always considered safe.

              Note that ----ppllaayylliisstt always loads all entries, so you use that  instead  if  you  really

              if the file is automatically scanned (e.g. thumbnail generation). If the thumbnail scan‐
              ner for example encounters a playlist file, which contains network URLs, and the scanner
              should not open these, enabling this option will prevent it. This option  also  disables
              ordered  chapters,  mov reference files, opening of archives, and a number of other fea‐
              tures.

              On older FFmpeg versions, this will not work in some cases. Some FFmpeg  demuxers  might
              not respect this option.

              This   option  does  not  prevent  opening  of  paired  subtitle  files  and  such.  Use
              ----aauuttoollooaadd--ffiilleess==nnoo to prevent this.

              This option does not always work if you open non-files (for example  using  ddvvdd::////ddiirreecc‐‐
              ttoorryy  would  open a whole bunch of files in the given directory). Prefixing the filename
              with ..// if it doesn't start with a // will avoid this.

       ----lloooopp--ppllaayylliisstt==<<NN||iinnff||ffoorrccee||nnoo>>,, ----lloooopp--ppllaayylliisstt
              Loops playback NN times. A value of 11 plays it one time (default), 22 two times, etc.  iinnff
              means  forever. nnoo is the same as 11 and disables looping. If several files are specified
              on command line,  the  entire  playlist  is  looped.  ----lloooopp--ppllaayylliisstt  is  the  same  as
              ----lloooopp--ppllaayylliisstt==iinnff.

              The ffoorrccee mode is like iinnff, but does not skip playlist entries which have been marked as
              failing. This means the player might waste CPU time trying to loop a file  that  doesn't
              exist. But it might be useful for playing webradios under very bad network conditions.

       ----lloooopp--ffiillee==<<NN||iinnff||nnoo>>,, ----lloooopp==<<NN||iinnff||nnoo>>
              Loop a single file N times. iinnff means forever, nnoo means normal playback. For compatibil‐
              ity,  ----lloooopp--ffiillee  and  ----lloooopp--ffiillee==yyeess  are  also  accepted,  and  are  the   same   as
              ----lloooopp--ffiillee==iinnff.

              The  difference to ----lloooopp--ppllaayylliisstt is that this doesn't loop the playlist, just the file
              itself. If the playlist contains only a single file,  the  difference  between  the  two
              option is that this option performs a seek on loop, instead of reloading the file.

              ----lloooopp is an alias for this option.

       ----aabb--lloooopp--aa==<<ttiimmee>>,, ----aabb--lloooopp--bb==<<ttiimmee>>
              Set  loop  points.  If playback passes the bb timestamp, it will seek to the aa timestamp.
              Seeking past the bb point doesn't loop (this is intentional).

              If both options are set to nnoo or unset, looping is disabled.  Otherwise,  the  start/end
              of playback is used if one of the options is set to nnoo or unset.

              The  loop-points  can be adjusted at runtime with the corresponding properties. See also
              aabb--lloooopp command.

              Enabled by default.  Disable support for Matroska ordered chapters. mpv will not load or
              search for video segments from other files, and will also ignore any chapter order spec‐
              ified for the main file.

              Loads the given file as playlist, and tries to use the files contained in it  as  refer‐
              ence  files  when opening a Matroska file that uses ordered chapters. This overrides the
              normal mechanism for loading referenced files by scanning the same  directory  the  main
              file is located in.

              Useful  for  loading ordered chapter files that are not located on the local filesystem,
              or if the referenced files are in different directories.

              Note: a playlist can be as simple as a text file containing filenames separated by  new‐
              lines.

              Load  chapters  from  this file, instead of using the chapter metadata found in the main
              file.

              This accepts a media file (like mkv) or even a pseudo-format like  ffmetadata  and  uses
              its  chapters  to replace the current file's chapters. This doesn't work with OGM or XML
              chapters directly.

              Opens  the  given path for writing, and print log messages to it. Existing files will be
              truncated. The log level is at least --vv --vv, but  can  be  raised  via  ----mmssgg--lleevveell  (the
              option cannot lower it below the forced minimum log level).

       ----ccoonnffiigg--ddiirr==<<ppaatthh>>
              Force  a  different configuration directory. If this is set, the given directory is used
              to load configuration files, and all other configuration directories are  ignored.  This
              means  the  global  mpv  configuration  directory  as  well  as per-user directories are
              ignored, and overrides through environment variables (MMPPVV__HHOOMMEE) are also ignored.

              Note that the ----nnoo--ccoonnffiigg option takes precedence over this option.

              Always save the current playback position on quit. When this file is played again later,
              the  player  will  seek  to  the old playback position on start. This does not happen if
              playback of a file is stopped in any other way than quitting. For example, going to  the
              next  file  in  the playlist will not save the position, and start playback at beginning
              the next time the file is played.

              This behavior is disabled by default, but is always available when quitting  the  player
              with Shift+Q.

          The directory in which to store the "watch later" temporary files.

          The  default  is a subdirectory named "watch_later" underneath the config directory (usually
          ~~//..ccoonnffiigg//mmppvv//).

       ----dduummpp--ssttaattss==<<ffiilleennaammee>>
              Write certain statistics to the given file. The file is truncated on opening.  The  file
              will  contain raw samples, each with a timestamp. To make this file into a readable, the
              script TTOOOOLLSS//ssttaattss--ccoonnvv..ppyy can be used (which currently displays it as a graph).

              Makes mpv wait idly instead of quitting when there is no file to play.  Mostly useful in
              input mode, where mpv can be controlled through input commands. (Default: nnoo)

              oonnccee  will  only idle at start and let the player close once the first playlist has fin‐
              ished playing back.

       ----ssccrriipptt==<<ffiilleennaammee>>

              Set  options  for scripts. A script can query an option by key. If an option is used and
              what semantics the option value has depends entirely on the loaded scripts.  Values  not

              Normally,  mpv will try to keep all settings when playing the next file on the playlist,
              even if they were changed by the user during playback. (This behavior is the opposite of
              MPlayer's, which tries to reset all settings when starting next file.)

              Default: Do not reset anything.

              This  can  be changed with this option. It accepts a list of options, and mpv will reset
              the value of these options on playback start to the initial value. The initial value  is
              either the default value, or as set by the config file or command line.

              In some cases, this might not work as expected. For example, ----vvoolluummee will only be reset
              if it is explicitly set in the config file or the command line.

              The special name aallll resets as many options as possible.

              Enable  the  youtube-dl  hook-script.  It  will look at the input URL, and will play the
              video located on the website. This works with many streaming sites,  not  just  the  one
              that  the  script  is  named  after.  This requires a recent version of youtube-dl to be
              installed on the system. (Enabled by default.)

              If the script can't do anything with an URL, it will do nothing.

              The ttrryy__yyttddll__ffiirrsstt script option accepts a boolean 'yes' or 'no', and if 'yes' will  try
              parsing  the URL with youtube-dl first, instead of the default where it's only after mpv
              failed to open it. This mostly depends on whether most  of  your  URLs  need  youtube-dl
              parsing.

              The  eexxcclluuddee  script  option accepts a ||-separated list of URL patterns which mpv should
              not use with youtube-dl. The patterns are matched after the hhttttpp((ss)):://// part of the URL.

              ^^ matches the beginning of the URL, $$ matches its end, and you should use %%  before  any
              of the characters ^^$$(())%%||,,..[[]]**++--?? to match that character.

              The  uussee__mmaanniiffeessttss  script option makes mpv use the master manifest URL for formats like

              key-value pair. Options without argument must include ==.

              There  is  no  sanity  checking  so it's possible to break things (i.e.  passing invalid
              parameters to youtube-dl).

              A proxy URL can be passed for youtube-dl to use it in parsing the website.  This is use‐
              ful  for  geo-restricted  URLs. After youtube-dl parsing, some URLs also require a proxy
              for playback, so this can pass that proxy information to mpv. Take note that SOCKS prox‐
              ies  aren't supported and https URLs also bypass the proxy. This is a limitation in FFm‐
              peg.

       ----ffrraammeeddrroopp==<<mmooddee>>
              Skip displaying some frames to maintain A/V sync on slow systems, or playing high  fram‐
              erate video on video outputs that have an upper framerate limit.

              The argument selects the drop methods, and can be one of the following:

              <<nnoo>>   Disable any framedropping.

              <<vvoo>>   Drop  late  frames  on video output (default). This still decodes and filters all
                     frames, but doesn't render them on the VO. It tries to query the display FPS (X11
                     only,  not  correct on multi-monitor systems), or assumes infinite display FPS if
                     that fails. Drops are indicated in the terminal status line as DDrrooppppeedd:: field. If
                     the  decoder  is too slow, in theory all frames would have to be dropped (because
                     all frames are too late) - to avoid this, frame dropping stops if  the  effective
                     framerate is below 10 FPS.

              <<ddeeccooddeerr>>
                     Old,  decoder-based  framedrop  mode. (This is the same as ----ffrraammeeddrroopp==yyeess in mpv
                     0.5.x and before.) This tells the decoder to skip frames (unless they are  needed
                     to decode future frames). May help with slow systems, but can produce unwatchable
                     choppy output, or even freeze  the  display  completely.  Not  recommended.   The

                 ----vvoo==vvddppaauu  has  its  own code for the vvoo framedrop mode. Slight differences to other
                 VOs are possible.

              Enable some things which tend to reduce video latency by 1 or 2  frames  (default:  no).
              Note that this option might be removed without notice once the player's timing code does
              not inherently need to do these things anymore.

              This does:

              · Use the demuxer reported FPS for frame dropping. This avoids that the player needs  to
                decode  1  frame in advance, lowering total latency in effect. This also means that if
                the demuxer reported FPS is wrong, or the video filter chain changes FPS  (e.g.  dein‐
                terlacing), then it could drop too many or not enough frames.

              · Disable  waiting  for  the  first video frame. Normally the player waits for the first
                video frame to be fully rendered before starting  playback  properly.  Some  VOs  will
                lazily  initialize stuff when rendering the first frame, so if this is not done, there
                is some likeliness that the VO has to drop some frames if rendering  the  first  frame
                takes longer than needed.

       ----ddiissppllaayy--ffppss==<<ffppss>>
              Set  the  display FPS used with the ----vviiddeeoo--ssyynncc==ddiissppllaayy--** modes. By default, a detected
              value is used. Keep in mind that setting an incorrect value (even if slightly incorrect)
              can  ruin  video playback. On multi-monitor systems, there is a chance that the detected
              value is from the wrong monitor.

              Set this option only if you have reason to believe the automatically determined value is
              wrong.

       ----hhwwddeecc==<<aappii>>
              Specify  the hardware video decoding API that should be used if possible.  Whether hard‐
              ware decoding is actually done depends on the video codec. If hardware decoding  is  not
              possible, mpv will fall back on software decoding.

              aauuttoo  tries  to automatically enable hardware decoding using the first available method.
              This still depends what VO you are using. For example, if you are not using ----vvoo==ggppuu  or
              ----vvoo==vvddppaauu,  vdpau  decoding  will  never  be enabled. Also note that if the first found
              method doesn't actually work, it will always fall back to software decoding, instead  of
              trying the next method (might matter on some Linux systems).

              aauuttoo--ccooppyy selects only modes that copy the video data back to system memory after decod‐
              ing. This selects modes like vvaaaappii--ccooppyy (and so on).  If none of  these  work,  hardware
              decoding  is  disabled.  This mode is always guaranteed to incur no additional loss com‐
              pared to software decoding, and will allow CPU processing with video filters.

              The vvaaaappii mode, if used with ----vvoo==ggppuu, requires Mesa 11 and most likely works with Intel
              GPUs only. It also requires the opengl EGL backend.

              The  ccuuddaa  and  ccuuddaa--ccooppyy modes provides deinterlacing in the decoder which is useful as
              there is no other deinterlacing mechanism in the opengl output path. To use  this  dein‐
              terlacing  you  must  pass the option: vvdd--llaavvcc--oo==ddeeiinntt==[[wweeaavvee||bboobb||aaddaappttiivvee]].  Pass wweeaavvee
              (or leave the option unset) to not attempt any deinterlacing. ccuuddaa should always be pre‐
              ferred unless the ggppuu vo is not being used or filters are required.

              nnvvddeecc  is  a newer implementation of CUVID/CUDA decoding, which uses the FFmpeg decoders
              for file parsing. Experimental, is known not to correctly check whether decoding is sup‐
              ported  by the hardware at all. Deinterlacing is not supported. Since this uses FFmpeg's
              codec parsers, it is expected that this generally causes fewer issues than ccuuddaa.

              Most video filters will not work with hardware decoding as  they  are  primarily  imple‐
              mented on the CPU. Some exceptions are vvddppaauupppp, vvddppaauurrbb and vvaavvpppp. See _V_I_D_E_O _F_I_L_T_E_R_S for
              more details.

              The ......--ccooppyy modes (e.g. ddxxvvaa22--ccooppyy) allow you to use hardware  decoding  with  any  VO,
              backend  or  filter.  Because  these  copy the decoded video back to system RAM, they're
              likely less efficient than the direct modes (like e.g. ddxxvvaa22),  and  probably  not  more
              efficient than software decoding except for some codecs (e.g. HEVC).

              NNOOTTEE::
                 When  using  this  switch,  hardware decoding is still only done for some codecs. See
                 ----hhwwddeecc--ccooddeeccss to enable hardware decoding for more codecs.

                 Quality reduction with hardware decoding

                        In theory, hardware decoding does not reduce video quality (at least  for  the
                        codecs  h264  and HEVC). However, due to restrictions in video output APIs, as
                        well as bugs in the actual hardware decoders, there can be some loss, or  even
                        blatantly incorrect results.

                        In  some  cases,  RGB  conversion is forced, which means the RGB conversion is
                        performed by the hardware  decoding  API,  instead  of  the  shaders  used  by
                        ----vvoo==ggppuu.  This  means certain colorspaces may not display correctly, and cer‐
                        tain filtering (such as debanding) cannot be applied in  an  ideal  way.  This
                        will  also  usually force the use of low quality chroma scalers instead of the
                        one specified by ----ccssccaallee. In other cases, hardware decoding can  also  reduce
                        the  bit  depth of the decoded image, which can introduce banding or precision
                        loss for 10-bit files.

                        vvddppaauu is usually safe. If deinterlacing enabled (or the vvddppaauupppp  video  filter
                        is active in general), it forces RGB conversion. The latter currently does not
                        treat certain colorspaces like BT.2020 correctly (which is mostly  a  mpv-spe‐
                        cific restriction). The vvddppaauupprrbb video filter retrieves image data without RGB
                        conversion and is safe (but precludes use of vdpau postprocessing).

                        vvaaaappii is safe if the vvaaaappii--eeggll backend is indicated in the logs. If  vvaaaappii--ggllxx
                        is  indicated,  and the video colorspace is either BT.601 or BT.709, a forced,
                        low-quality but correct RGB conversion is  performed.  Otherwise,  the  result
                        will be totally incorrect.

                        dd33dd1111vvaa  is  safe  when  used with the dd33dd1111 backend. If used with aannggllee is it
                        usually safe, except that 10 bit input (HEVC main 10 profiles) will be rounded
                        down to 8 bits, which will result in reduced quality. Also note that with very
                        old ANGLE builds (without EEGGLL__KKHHRR__ssttrreeaamm ppaatthh,) all input will be converted to
                        RGB.

                        ddxxvvaa22  is not safe. It appears to always use BT.601 for forced RGB conversion,
                        but actual behavior depends on the GPU drivers. Some drivers appear to convert
                        to  limited  range  RGB,  which  gives  a  faded  appearance.   In addition to
                        driver-specific behavior, global system settings might affect  this  addition‐
                        ally.  This  can  give  incorrect  results even with completely ordinary video
                        sources.

                        rrppii always uses the hardware overlay renderer, even with ----vvoo==ggppuu.

                        ccuuddaa should be safe, but it has been reported to corrupt the timestamps  caus‐
                        ing  glitched, flashing frames on some files. It can also sometimes cause mas‐
                        sive framedrops for unknown reasons. Caution is advised.

                        ccrryyssttaallhhdd is not safe. It always converts to 4:2:2 YUV, which  may  be  lossy,
                        depending  on  how chroma sub-sampling is done during conversion. It also dis‐
                        cards the top left pixel of each frame for some reason.

                        All other methods, in particular the copy-back methods (like ddxxvvaa22--ccooppyy  etc.)
                        should  hopefully  be  safe,  although  they  can  still cause random decoding
                        issues. At the very least, they shouldn't affect the colors of the image.

                        In particular, aauuttoo--ccooppyy will only select "safe" modes  (although  potentially
                        slower than other methods), but there's still no guarantee the chosen hardware
                        decoder will actually work correctly.

                        In general, it's very strongly advised to avoid hardware decoding unless aabbssoo‐‐
                        lluutteellyy necessary, i.e. if your CPU is insufficient to decode the file in ques‐
                        tions. If you run into any weird decoding issues, frame  glitches  or  discol‐
                        oration,  and  you  have  ----hhwwddeecc turned on, the first thing you should try is
                        disabling it.

       ----ggppuu--hhwwddeecc--iinntteerroopp==<<aauuttoo||aallll||nnoo||nnaammee>>
              This option is for troubleshooting hwdec interop issues. Since it's a debugging  option,
              its semantics may change at any time.

              This  is  useful for the ggppuu and ooppeennggll--ccbb VOs for selecting which hwdec interop context
              to use exactly. Effectively it also can be used to block loading of certain backends.

              If set to aauuttoo (default), the behavior depends on the VO: for ggppuu, it does nothing,  and
              the  interop  context is loaded on demand (when the decoder probes for ----hhwwddeecc support).
              For ooppeennggll--ccbb, which has has no on-demand loading, this is equivalent to aallll.

              The empty string is equivalent to aauuttoo.

              If set to aallll, it attempts to load all interop contexts at GL context creation time.

              Other than that, a specific backend can be set, and the list of them can be queried with
              hheellpp (mpv CLI only).

              Runtime  changes to this are ignored (the current option value is used whenever the ren‐
              derer is created).

              The old aliases ----ooppeennggll--hhwwddeecc--iinntteerroopp and ----hhwwddeecc--pprreellooaadd are barely  related  to  this
              anymore, but will be somewhat compatible in some cases.

       ----hhwwddeecc--iimmaaggee--ffoorrmmaatt==<<nnaammee>>
              Set  the  internal  pixel format used by hardware decoding via ----hhwwddeecc (default nnoo). The
              special value nnoo selects an implementation specific standard format. Most decoder imple‐
              mentations  support  only  one  format, and will fail to initialize if the format is not
              supported.

              Some implementations might support multiple  formats.  In  particular,  videotoolbox  is
              known to require uuyyvvyy442222 for good performance on some older hardware. d3d11va can always
              use yyuuvv442200pp, which uses an opaque format, with likely no advantages.

       ----ccuuddaa--ddeeccooddee--ddeevviiccee==<<aauuttoo||00....>>
              Choose the GPU device used for decoding when using the ccuuddaa hwdec.

              By default, the device that is being used to provide OpenGL output will also be used for
              decoding (and in the vast majority of cases, only one GPU will be present).

              Note  that  when  using  the  ccuuddaa--ccooppyy  hwdec,  a  different  option  must  be  passed:
              ----vvdd--llaavvcc--oo==ggppuu==<<00....>>.

              Choose the DRM device for vvaaaappii--ccooppyy. This should be the path  to  a  DRM  device  file.
              (Default: //ddeevv//ddrrii//rreennddeerrDD112288)

       ----ppaannssccaann==<<00..00--11..00>>
              Enables  pan-and-scan  functionality (cropping the sides of e.g. a 16:9 video to make it
              fit a 4:3 display without black bands). The range controls how  much  of  the  image  is
              cropped. May not work with all video output drivers.

              This option has no effect if ----vviiddeeoo--uunnssccaalleedd option is used.

       ----vviiddeeoo--aassppeecctt==<<rraattiioo||nnoo>>
              Override  video  aspect ratio, in case aspect information is incorrect or missing in the
              file being played. See also ----nnoo--vviiddeeoo--aassppeecctt.

              These values have special meaning:

              00      disable aspect ratio handling, pretend the video has square pixels

              nnoo     same as 00

              --11     use the video stream or container aspect (default)

              But note that handling of these special values might change in the future.

              This sets the default video aspect determination method (if the aspect is _not_ overrid‐
              den by the user with ----vviiddeeoo--aassppeecctt or others).

              ccoonnttaaiinneerr
                     Strictly prefer the container aspect ratio. This is apparently the default behav‐
                     ior with VLC, at least with Matroska. Note that if the container  has  no  aspect
                     ratio set, the behavior is the same as with bitstream.

              bbiittssttrreeaamm
                     Strictly  prefer the bitstream aspect ratio, unless the bitstream aspect ratio is
                     not set. This is apparently the default behavior with XBMC/kodi,  at  least  with
                     Matroska.

              The current default for mpv is ccoonnttaaiinneerr.

              Normally  you  should  not set this. Try the various choices if you encounter video that
              has the wrong aspect ratio in mpv, but seems to be correct in other players.

       ----vviiddeeoo--uunnssccaalleedd==<<nnoo||yyeess||ddoowwnnssccaallee--bbiigg>>
              Disable scaling of the video. If the window is larger than the  video,  black  bars  are
              added.  Otherwise,  the  video is cropped, unless the option is set to ddoowwnnssccaallee--bbiigg, in
              which case the video is fit to window. The video still can be influenced  by  the  other
              ----vviiddeeoo--...... options. This option disables the effect of ----ppaannssccaann.

              Note  that  the  scaler algorithm may still be used, even if the video isn't scaled. For
              example, this can influence chroma conversion. The video will also still  be  scaled  in
              one dimension if the source uses non-square pixels (e.g. anamorphic widescreen DVDs).

              This option is disabled if the ----nnoo--kkeeeeppaassppeecctt option is used.

              Moves the displayed video rectangle by the given value in the X or Y direction. The unit
              is in fractions of the size of the scaled video (the full size, even  if  parts  of  the
              video are not visible due to panscan or other options).

              For  example,  displaying  a  1280x720  video  fullscreen  on  a  1680x1050  screen with
              ----vviiddeeoo--ppaann--xx==--00..11 would move the video 168 pixels to the left (making 128 pixels of the
              source video invisible).

              Rotate  the  video  clockwise,  in degrees. Currently supports 90° steps only.  If nnoo is
              given, the video is never rotated, even if the file has rotation metadata. (The rotation
              value  is added to the rotation metadata, which means the value 00 would rotate the video
              according to the rotation metadata.)

              Set the stereo 3D output mode (default: mmoonnoo). This is mostly  broken  and  thus  depre‐
              cated.

              The pseudo-mode nnoo disables automatic conversion completely.

              The  mode  mmoonnoo  is  an  alias  to mmll, which refers to the left frame in 2D. This is the
              default, which means mpv will try to show 3D movies in 2D, instead  of  the  mangled  3D
              image  not  intended  for  consumption (such as showing the left and right frame side by
              side, etc.).

              documentation  to  see what the names mean. Note that some names refer to modes not sup‐
              ported by sstteerreeoo33dd - these modes can appear in files, but can't be handled  properly  by

              For  example,  ----vviiddeeoo--zzoooomm==00  is  unscaled,   ----vviiddeeoo--zzoooomm==11   is   twice   the   size,
              ----vviiddeeoo--zzoooomm==--22 is one fourth of the size, and so on.

              Moves  the  video rectangle within the black borders, which are usually added to pad the
              video to screen if video and screen aspect  ratios  are  different.   ----vviiddeeoo--aalliiggnn--yy==--11
              would  move  the video to the top of the screen (leaving a border only on the bottom), a
              value of 00 centers it (default), and a value of 11 would put the video at the  bottom  of
              the screen.

              If video and screen aspect match perfectly, these options do nothing.

              This option is disabled if the ----nnoo--kkeeeeppaassppeecctt option is used.

       ----ccoorrrreecctt--ppttss,, ----nnoo--ccoorrrreecctt--ppttss
              ----nnoo--ccoorrrreecctt--ppttss  switches  mpv to a mode where video timing is determined using a fixed
              framerate value (either using the ----ffppss option, or using file  information).  Sometimes,
              files  with  very  broken timestamps can be played somewhat well in this mode. Note that
              video filters, subtitle rendering, seeking (including hr-seeks  and  backstepping),  and
              audio synchronization can be completely broken in this mode.

       ----ffppss==<<ffllooaatt>>
              Override video framerate. Useful if the original value is wrong or missing.

              NNOOTTEE::
                 Works in ----nnoo--ccoorrrreecctt--ppttss mode only.

       ----ddeeiinntteerrllaaccee==<<yyeess||nnoo>>
              Enable  or  disable  interlacing  (default:  no).  Interlaced video shows ugly comb-like
              artifacts, which are visible on fast movement. Enabling this typically inserts the yadif
              video  filter in order to deinterlace the video, or lets the video output apply deinter‐
              lacing if supported.

              This behaves exactly like the ddeeiinntteerrllaaccee input property (usually mapped to dd).

              Keep in mind that this wwiillll  conflict  with  manually  inserted  deinterlacing  filters,
              unless you take care. (Since mpv 0.27.0, even the hardware deinterlace filters will con‐
              flict. Also since that version, ----ddeeiinntteerrllaaccee==aauuttoo was removed, which used to mean  that
              the default interlacing option of possibly inserted video filters was used.)

              Note that this will make video look worse if it's not actually interlaced.

       ----ffrraammeess==<<nnuummbbeerr>>
              Play/convert only first <<nnuummbbeerr>> video frames, then quit.

              ----ffrraammeess==00 loads the file, but immediately quits before initializing playback. (Might be
              useful for scripts which just want to determine some file properties.)

              For audio-only playback, any value greater than 0 will quit playback  immediately  after
              initialization. The value 0 works as with video.

       ----vviiddeeoo--oouuttppuutt--lleevveellss==<<oouuttppuuttlleevveellss>>
              RGB  color  levels  used with YUV to RGB conversion. Normally, output devices such as PC
              monitors use full range color levels. However, some TVs and video monitors expect studio
              RGB levels. Providing full range output to a device expecting studio level input results
              in crushed blacks and whites, the reverse in dim gray blacks and dim whites.

              Not all VOs support this option. Some will silently ignore it.

              Available color ranges are:

              aauuttoo   automatic selection (equals to full range) (default)

              lliimmiitteedd
                     limited range (16-235 per component), studio levels

              ffuullll   full range (0-255 per component), PC levels

              NNOOTTEE::
                 It is advisable to use your graphics driver's color range option instead,  if  avail‐
                 able.

       ----hhwwddeecc--ccooddeeccss==<<ccooddeecc11,,ccooddeecc22,,......||aallll>>
              Allow  hardware  decoding  for a given list of codecs only. The special value aallll always
              allows all codecs.

              You can get the list of allowed codecs with  mmppvv  ----vvdd==hheellpp.  Remove  the  prefix,  e.g.
              instead of llaavvcc::hh226644 use hh226644.

              By  default,  this  is  set to hh226644,,vvcc11,,wwmmvv33,,hheevvcc,,mmppeegg22vviiddeeoo,,vvpp99. Note that the hardware
              acceleration special codecs like hh226644__vvddppaauu are not relevant anymore, and in  fact  have
              been removed from Libav in this form.

              This  is  usually  only needed with broken GPUs, where a codec is reported as supported,
              but decoding causes more problems than it solves.

                 Example

                 mmppvv ----hhwwddeecc==vvddppaauu ----vvoo==vvddppaauu ----hhwwddeecc--ccooddeeccss==hh226644,,mmppeegg22vviiddeeoo
                        Enable vdpau decoding for h264 and mpeg2 only.

              Check hardware decoder profile (default: yes). If nnoo is set, the highest profile of  the
              hardware decoder is unconditionally selected, and decoding is forced even if the profile
              of the video is higher than that.  The result is most likely broken  decoding,  but  may
              also help if the detected or reported profiles are somehow incorrect.

       ----vvdd--llaavvcc--ssooffttwwaarree--ffaallllbbaacckk==<<yyeess||nnoo||NN>>
              Fallback to software decoding if the hardware-accelerated decoder fails (default: 3). If
              this is a number, then fallback will be triggered if N frames fail to decode in a row. 1
              is equivalent to yyeess.

       ----vvdd--llaavvcc--ddrr==<<yyeess||nnoo>>
              Enable direct rendering (default: yes). If this is set to yyeess, the video will be decoded
              directly to GPU video memory (or staging buffers).  This can speed up video upload,  and
              may  help  with  large  resolutions or slow hardware. This works only with the following
              VOs:

                 · ggppuu: requires at least OpenGL 4.4 or Vulkan.

              (In particular, this can't be made work with ooppeennggll--ccbb, but the libmpv  render  API  has
              optional support.)

              Using  video filters of any kind that write to the image data (or output newly allocated
              frames) will silently disable the DR code path.

       ----vvdd--llaavvcc--bbiitteexxaacctt

              Enable optimizations which do not comply with the format specification  and  potentially
              cause  problems,  like simpler dequantization, simpler motion compensation, assuming use
              of the default quantization matrix, assuming YUV 4:2:0 and  skipping  a  few  checks  to
              detect damaged bitstreams.

              Pass AVOptions to libavcodec decoder. Note, a patch to make the oo== unneeded and pass all
              unknown options through the AVOption system is welcome. A full list of AVOptions can  be
              found in the FFmpeg manual.

              Some  options  which used to be direct options can be set with this mechanism, like bbuugg,
              ggrraayy, iiddcctt, eecc, vviissmmvv, sskkiipp__ttoopp (was sstt), sskkiipp__bboottttoomm (was ssbb), ddeebbuugg.

                 Example

              Show even broken/corrupt frames (default: no). If this option is set to  no,  libavcodec
              won't  output frames that were either decoded before an initial keyframe was decoded, or
              frames that are recognized as corrupted.

       ----vvdd--llaavvcc--sskkiippllooooppffiilltteerr==<<sskkiippvvaalluuee>> ((HH..226644 oonnllyy))
              Skips the loop filter (AKA deblocking) during H.264 decoding. Since the  filtered  frame
              is  supposed  to  be  used  as reference for decoding dependent frames, this has a worse
              effect on quality than not doing deblocking on e.g. MPEG-2 video. But at least for  high
              bitrate HDTV, this provides a big speedup with little visible quality loss.

              <<sskkiippvvaalluuee>> can be one of the following:

              nnoonnee   Never skip.

              ddeeffaauulltt
                     Skip useless processing steps (e.g. 0 size packets in AVI).

              nnoonnrreeff Skip frames that are not referenced (i.e. not used for decoding other frames, the
                     error cannot "build up").

              bbiiddiirr  Skip B-Frames.

              nnoonnkkeeyy Skip all frames except keyframes.

              aallll    Skip all frames.

       ----vvdd--llaavvcc--sskkiippiiddcctt==<<sskkiippvvaalluuee>> ((MMPPEEGG--11//22 oonnllyy))
              Skips the IDCT step. This degrades quality a lot in almost all cases (see skiploopfilter
              for available skip values).

       ----vvdd--llaavvcc--sskkiippffrraammee==<<sskkiippvvaalluuee>>
              Skips  decoding  of  frames  completely. Big speedup, but jerky motion and sometimes bad
              artifacts (see skiploopfilter for available skip values).

       ----vvdd--llaavvcc--ffrraammeeddrroopp==<<sskkiippvvaalluuee>>
              Set framedropping mode used with ----ffrraammeeddrroopp (see skiploopfilter for available skip val‐
              ues).

       ----vvdd--llaavvcc--tthhrreeaaddss==<<NN>>
              Number  of  threads to use for decoding. Whether threading is actually supported depends
              on codec (default: 0). 0 means autodetect number of cores on the machine and  use  that,
              up to the maximum of 16. You can set more than 16 threads manually.

       ----vvdd--llaavvcc--aassssuummee--oolldd--xx226644==<<yyeess||nnoo>>
              Assume  the  video  was  encoded by an old, buggy x264 version (default: no).  Normally,
              this is autodetected by libavcodec. But if the bitstream contains no x264  version  info
              (or  it  was somehow skipped), and the stream was in fact encoded by an old x264 version
              (build 150 or earlier), and if the stream uses 44::44::44 chroma,  then  libavcodec  will  by
              default show corrupted video.  This option sets the libavcodec xx226644__bbuuiilldd option to 115500,
              which means that if the stream contains no version info, or was not encoded by  x264  at
              all,  it  assumes it was encoded by the old version. Enabling this option is pretty safe
              if you want your broken files to work, but in theory  this  can  break  on  streams  not
              encoded  by  x264,  or  if  a stream encoded by a newer x264 version contains no version
              info.

              If this is enabled (default), playing with a speed different from  normal  automatically
              inserts the ssccaalleetteemmppoo audio filter. For details, see audio filter section.

       ----aauuddiioo--ddeevviiccee==<<nnaammee>>
              Use the given audio device. This consists of the audio output name, e.g.  aallssaa, followed
              by //, followed by the audio output specific device name.  The  default  value  for  this
              option  is  aauuttoo,  which  tries  every audio output in preference order with the default
              device.

              You can list audio devices with ----aauuddiioo--ddeevviiccee==hheellpp. This outputs  the  device  name  in
              quotes,  followed  by  a  description.  The  device name is what you have to pass to the
              ----aauuddiioo--ddeevviiccee option. The list of audio devices can be retrieved by API  by  using  the
              aauuddiioo--ddeevviiccee--lliisstt property.

              While  the  option  normally takes one of the strings as indicated by the methods above,
              you can also force the device  for  most  AOs  by  building  it  manually.  For  example
              nnaammee//ffoooobbaarr  forces  the AO nnaammee to use the device ffoooobbaarr. However, the ----aaoo option will
              strictly force a specific AO. To avoid confusion,  don't  use  ----aaoo  and  ----aauuddiioo--ddeevviiccee
              together.

                 Example for ALSA

                        MPlayer and mplayer2 required you to replace any ',' with '.' and any ':' with
                        '='  in  the  ALSA  device  name.  For  example,  to  use  the  device   named
                        ddmmiixx::ddeeffaauulltt, you had to do:
                     --aaoo aallssaa::ddeevviiccee==ddmmiixx==ddeeffaauulltt

                 In mpv you could instead use:
                     ----aauuddiioo--ddeevviiccee==aallssaa//ddmmiixx::ddeeffaauulltt

       ----aauuddiioo--eexxcclluussiivvee==<<yyeess||nnoo>>
              Enable  exclusive  output mode. In this mode, the system is usually locked out, and only
              mpv will be able to output audio.

              This only works for some audio outputs, such as wwaassaappii and ccoorreeaauuddiioo. Other  audio  out‐
              puts silently ignore this options. They either have no concept of exclusive mode, or the
              mpv side of the implementation is missing.

       ----aauuddiioo--ffaallllbbaacckk--ttoo--nnuullll==<<yyeess||nnoo>>
              If no audio device can be opened, behave as if ----aaoo==nnuullll was given. This  is  useful  in
              combination with ----aauuddiioo--ddeevviiccee: instead of causing an error if the selected device does
              not exist, the client API user (or a Lua script) could let playback  continue  normally,

       ----aauuddiioo--ssppddiiff==<<ccooddeeccss>>
              List of codecs for which compressed audio passthrough should be  used.  This  works  for
              both classic S/PDIF and HDMI.

              Possible codecs are aacc33, ddttss, ddttss--hhdd, eeaacc33, ttrruueehhdd.  Multiple codecs can be specified by
              separating them with ,,. ddttss refers to low bitrate DTS core, while ddttss--hhdd refers  to  DTS
              MA  (receiver  and  OS support varies). If both ddttss and ddttss--hhdd are specified, it behaves
              equivalent to specifying ddttss--hhdd only.

              In earlier mpv versions you could use ----aadd to force the spdif wrapper.   This  does  not
              work anymore.

                 Warning

                        There  is not much reason to use this. HDMI supports uncompressed multichannel
                        PCM, and mpv supports lossless DTS-HD decoding via FFmpeg's  new  DCA  decoder
                        (based on libdcadec).

       ----aadd==<<ddeeccooddeerr11,,ddeeccooddeerr22,,......[[--]]>>
              Specify  a  priority list of audio decoders to be used, according to their decoder name.
              When determining which decoder to use, the first decoder that matches the  audio  format
              is  selected.  If  that  is unavailable, the next decoder is used. Finally, it tries all
              other decoders that are not explicitly selected or rejected by the option.

              -- at the end of the list suppresses fallback on other available decoders not on the ----aadd
              list.  ++  in  front of an entry forces the decoder. Both of these should not normally be
              used, because they break normal decoder auto-selection! Both of these methods are depre‐
              cated.

              Set the startup volume. 0 means silence, 100 means no volume reduction or amplification.
              Negative values can be passed for compatibility, but are treated as 0.

              Since mpv 0.18.1, this always controls the internal mixer (aka "softvol").

              Gain  in  dB to apply if the file has no replay gain tags. This option is always applied
              if the replaygain logic is somehow inactive. If this is  applied,  no  other  replaygain

       ----aauuddiioo--ddeellaayy==<<sseecc>>
              Audio  delay  in  seconds  (positive or negative float value). Positive values delay the

       ----mmuuttee==<<yyeess||nnoo||aauuttoo>>
              Set startup audio mute status (default: no).

              aauuttoo is a deprecated possible value that is equivalent to nnoo.

              Deprecated/unfunctional. Before mpv 0.18.1, this used to control whether to use the vol‐
              ume controls of the audio output driver or the internal mpv volume filter.

              The current behavior is that softvol is always enabled, i.e. as if this option is set to
              yyeess. The other behaviors are not available anymore, although aauuttoo almost matches current
              behavior in most cases.

              The  nnoo  behavior is still partially available through the aaoo--vvoolluummee and aaoo--mmuuttee proper‐

              Select the Dynamic Range Compression level for AC-3 audio streams.  <<lleevveell>> is  a  float
              value  ranging  from  0  to 1, where 0 means no compression (which is the default) and 1
              means full compression (make loud passages more silent and vice versa). Values up  to  6
              are  also accepted, but are purely experimental. This option only shows an effect if the
              AC-3 stream contains the required range compression information.

              The standard mandates that DRC is enabled by default, but mpv (and some  other  players)
              ignore this for the sake of better audio quality.

                       List of ,,-separated channel layouts which should be allowed.  Technically, this
                       only  adjusts  the filter chain output to the best matching layout in the list,
                       and passes the result to the audio API.  It's possible that the audio API  will
                       select a different channel layout.

                       Using this mode is recommended for direct hardware output, especially over HDMI
                       (see HDMI warning below).

                       Force  a plain stereo downmix. This is a special-case  of  the  previous  item.
                       (See paragraphs below for implications.)

              If  a  list of layouts is given, each item can be either an explicit channel layout name
              (like 55..11), or a channel number. Channel numbers refer to default layouts, e.g. 2  chan‐
              nels refer to stereo, 6 refers to 5.1.

              See  ----aauuddiioo--cchhaannnneellss==hheellpp  output  for defined default layouts. This also lists speaker
              names, which can be used to express arbitrary channel layouts (e.g. ffll--ffrr--llffee is 2.1).

              If the list of channel layouts has only 1 item, the decoder is asked to produce  accord‐
              ing  output.  This sometimes triggers decoder-downmix, which might be different from the
              normal mpv downmix. (Only some decoders support remixing audio, like AC-3, AAC  or  DTS.
              You  can  use ----aadd--llaavvcc--ddoowwnnmmiixx==nnoo to make the decoder always output its native layout.)
              One consequence is that ----aauuddiioo--cchhaannnneellss==sstteerreeoo triggers decoder downmix, while aauuttoo  or
              aauuttoo--ssaaffee  never  will,  even  if they end up selecting stereo. This happens because the
              decision whether to use decoder downmix happens long before the audio device is opened.

              If the channel layout of the media file (i.e. the decoder) and the AO's  channel  layout
              don't match, mpv will attempt to insert a conversion filter.  You may need to change the
              channel layout of the system mixer to achieve your desired output as mpv does  not  have
              control  over  it.  Another  work-around  for  this on some AOs is to use ----aauuddiioo--eexxcclluu‐‐
              ssiivvee==yyeess to circumvent the system mixer entirely.

                 Warning

                        Using aauuttoo can cause issues when using audio over HDMI. The OS will  typically
                        report  all channel layouts that _can_ go over HDMI, even if the receiver does
                        not support them. If a receiver gets an  unsupported  channel  layout,  random
                        things can happen, such as dropping the additional channels, or adding noise.

                        You  are recommended to set an explicit whitelist of the layouts you want. For
                        example, most A/V receivers connected via HDMI and that can do 7.1  would   be

              yyeess    The audio device is opened using parameters chosen for the first file played  and
                     is  then  kept  open  for gapless playback. This means that if the first file for
                     example has a low sample rate, then the following files may get resampled to  the
                     same  low sample rate, resulting in reduced sound quality. If you play files with
                     different parameters, consider  using  options  such  as  ----aauuddiioo--ssaammpplleerraattee  and
                     ----aauuddiioo--ffoorrmmaatt to explicitly select what the shared output format will be.

              wweeaakk   Normally,  the  audio device is kept open (using the format it was first initial‐
                     ized with). If the audio format the decoder output changes, the audio  device  is
                     closed  and  reopened.  This  means that you will normally get gapless audio with
                     files that were encoded using the same settings, but  might  not  be  gapless  in
                     other  cases.   The exact conditions under which the audio device is kept open is
                     an implementation detail, and can change from version to version.  Currently, the
                     device is kept even if the sample format changes, but the sample formats are con‐
                     vertible.

                 This feature is implemented in a simple manner and  relies  on  audio  output  device
                 buffering  to continue playback while moving from one file to another. If playback of
                 the new file starts slowly, for example because it is played from  a  remote  network
                 location  or because you have specified cache settings that require time for the ini‐
                 tial cache fill, then the buffered audio may run out before playback of the new  file
                 can start.

              When  starting  a video file or after events such as seeking, mpv will by default modify
              the audio stream to make it start from the same timestamp as video, by either  inserting
              silence  at the start or cutting away the first samples. Disabling this option makes the
              player behave like older mpv versions did: video and audio are both started  immediately
              even  if  their  start timestamps differ, and then video timing is gradually adjusted if
              necessary to reach correct synchronization later.

              Set the audio output minimum buffer. The audio device might  actually  create  a  larger
              buffer  if  it  pleases.  If  the  device  creates a smaller buffer, additional audio is
              buffered in an additional software buffer.

              Making this larger will make soft-volume and other filters react slower, introduce addi‐
              tional  issues on playback speed change, and block the player on audio format changes. A
              smaller buffer might lead to audio dropouts.

              This option should be used for testing only. If a non-default value helps significantly,
              the mpv developers should be contacted.

              Default: 0.2 (200 ms).

              Cash-grab  consumer  audio  hardware  (such as A/V receivers) often ignore initial audio
              sent over HDMI. This can happen every time audio over HDMI is stopped  and  resumed.  In
              order  to  compensate  for  this,  you can enable this option to not to stop and restart
              audio on seeks, and fill the gaps with silence. Likewise, when pausing  playback,  audio
              is  not  stopped,  and  silence  is  played while paused. Note that if no audio track is
              selected, the audio device will still be closed immediately.

              Not all AOs support this.

              player  will  wait for the given amount of seconds after opening the audio device before
              sending actual audio data to it. Useful if your expensive hardware discards the first  1
              or  2  seconds  of audio data sent to it. If ----aauuddiioo--ssttrreeaamm--ssiilleennccee==yyeess is not set, this

          Changing styling and position does not work with all subtitles. Image-based subtitles  (DVD,
          Bluray/PGS,  DVB)  cannot changed for fundamental reasons.  Subtitles in ASS format are nor‐
          mally not changed intentionally, but overriding them can be controlled with  ----ssuubb--aassss--oovveerr‐‐
          rriiddee.

          Previously  some  options  working  on text subtitles were called ----ssuubb--tteexxtt--**, they are now
          named ----ssuubb--**, and those specifically for ASS have been renamed from ----aassss--** to ----ssuubb--aassss--**.
          They are now all in this section.

       ----ssuubb--ddeellaayy==<<sseecc>>
              Delays subtitles by <<sseecc>> seconds. Can be negative.

              Add a subtitle file to the list of external subtitles.

              If you use ----ssuubb--ffiillee only once, this subtitle file is displayed by default.

              If ----ssuubb--ffiillee is used multiple times, the subtitle to use can be switched at runtime  by
              cycling  subtitle  tracks.  It's  possible  to  show two subtitles at once: use ----ssiidd to
              select the first subtitle index, and ----sseeccoonnddaarryy--ssiidd to select the  second  index.  (The
              index is printed on the terminal output after the ----ssiidd== in the list of streams.)

              ----ssuubb--ffiilleess is a list option (see _L_i_s_t _O_p_t_i_o_n_s  for details), and can take multiple file
              names separated by :: (Unix) or ;; (Windows), while  ----ssuubb--ffiillee takes a  single  filename,
              but  can  be  used  multiple  times  to add multiple files. Technically, ----ssuubb--ffiillee is a
              CLI/config file only alias for  ----ssuubb--ffiilleess--aappppeenndd.

              Select a secondary subtitle stream. This is similar to ----ssiidd. If a secondary subtitle is
              selected,  it will be rendered as toptitle (i.e. on the top of the screen) alongside the
              normal subtitle, and provides a way to render two subtitles at once.

              There are some caveats associated with this feature. For example, bitmap subtitles  will
              always  be rendered in their usual position, so selecting a bitmap subtitle as secondary
              subtitle will result in overlapping subtitles.  Secondary subtitles are never  shown  on
              the terminal if video is disabled.

              NNOOTTEE::
                 Styling  and interpretation of any formatting tags is disabled for the secondary sub‐
                 title. Internally, the same mechanism as ----nnoo--ssuubb--aassss is used to strip the styling.

              NNOOTTEE::
                 If the main subtitle stream contains formatting tags which display  the  subtitle  at
                 the  top of the screen, it will overlap with the secondary subtitle. To prevent this,
                 you could use ----nnoo--ssuubb--aassss to disable styling in the main subtitle stream.

              Whether  to  scale  subtitles  with the window size (default: yes). If this is disabled,
              changing the window size won't change the subtitle font size.

              Like ----ssuubb--ssccaallee, this can break ASS subtitles.

              Make the subtitle font size relative to the window, instead of the video.  This is  use‐
              ful  if  you  always want the same font size, even if the video doesn't cover the window
              fully, e.g. because screen aspect and window aspect mismatch (and the player adds  black
              bars).

              Default: yes.

              This  option  is  misnamed.  The  difference  to the confusingly similar sounding option
              ----ssuubb--ssccaallee--bbyy--wwiinnddooww is that ----ssuubb--ssccaallee--wwiitthh--wwiinnddooww still scales with the  approximate
              window size, while the other option disables this scaling.

              Stretch SSA/ASS subtitles when playing anamorphic videos for compatibility  with  tradi‐
              tional VSFilter behavior. This switch has no effect when the video is stored with square
              pixels.

              The renderer historically most commonly used for the SSA/ASS subtitle formats, VSFilter,
              had  questionable  behavior  that resulted in subtitles being stretched too if the video
              was stored in anamorphic format that required scaling for  display.   This  behavior  is
              usually  undesirable  and  newer VSFilter versions may behave differently. However, many
              existing scripts compensate for the stretching  by  modifying  things  in  the  opposite
              direction.   Thus,  if  such  scripts are displayed "correctly", they will not appear as
              intended.  This switch enables emulation of the old VSFilter behavior  (undesirable  but
              expected by many existing scripts).

              Enabled by default.

              Scale  \\bblluurr tags by video resolution instead of script resolution (enabled by default).
              This is bug in VSFilter, which according to some, can't be fixed anymore in the name  of
              compatibility.

              Note that this uses the actual video resolution for calculating the offset scale factor,
              not what the video filter chain or the video output use.

              Mangle colors like (xy-)vsfilter do (default: basic).  Historically,  VSFilter  was  not
              color  space  aware.  This  was  no problem as long as the color space used for SD video
              (BT.601) was used. But when everything switched to HD (BT.709), VSFilter was still  con‐
              verting  RGB colors to BT.601, rendered them into the video frame, and handled the frame
              to the video output, which would use BT.709 for conversion to RGB. The result were  man‐
              gled subtitle colors. Later on, bad hacks were added on top of the ASS format to control
              how colors are to be mangled.

              bbaassiicc  Handle only BT.601->BT.709 mangling, if the subtitles seem to indicate that  this
                     is required (default).

              ffuullll   Handle  the  full  YYCCbbCCrr  MMaattrriixx  header with all video color spaces supported by
                     libass and mpv. This might lead to bad breakages  in  corner  cases  and  is  not
                     strictly needed for compatibility (hopefully), which is why this is not default.

              ffoorrccee--660011
                     Force  BT.601->BT.709  mangling,  regardless  of  subtitle headers or video color
                     space.

              nnoo     Disable color mangling completely. All colors are RGB.

              Choosing anything other than nnoo will make the subtitle color depend on the  video  color
              space,  and  it's  for  example  in  theory not possible to reuse a subtitle script with
              another video file. The ----ssuubb--aassss--oovveerrrriiddee option doesn't  affect  how  this  option  is
              interpreted.

              Stretch  DVD  subtitles when playing anamorphic videos for better looking fonts on badly
              mastered DVDs. This switch has no effect when the video is stored with square  pixels  -
              which for DVD input cannot be the case though.

              Many  studios  tend  to use bitmap fonts designed for square pixels when authoring DVDs,
              causing the fonts to look stretched on playback on DVD players. This option fixes  them,
              however at the price of possibly misaligning some subtitles (e.g. sign translations).

              Disabled by default.

              Stretch  DVD  and  other image subtitles to the screen, ignoring the video margins. This
              has a similar effect as ----ssuubb--uussee--mmaarrggiinnss for  text  subtitles,  except  that  the  text
              itself  will  be  stretched,  not  only  just  repositioned.  (At least in general it is
              unavoidable, as an image bitmap can in theory consist of a single  bitmap  covering  the
              whole screen, and the player won't know where exactly the text parts are located.)

              This option does not display subtitles correctly. Use with care.

              Disabled by default.

              Override  the  image  subtitle  resolution with the video resolution (default: no). Nor‐
              mally, the subtitle canvas is fit into the video canvas (e.g. letterboxed). Setting this
              option  uses the video size as subtitle canvas size. Can be useful to test broken subti‐
              tles, which often happen when the video was trancoded, while attempting to keep the  old
              subtitles.

              You can use this option to specify the subtitle codepage. uchardet will be used to guess
              the  charset.  (If  mpv  was  not  compiled  with  uchardet, then uuttff--88 is the effective
              default.)

              The default value for this option is aauuttoo, which enables autodetection.

              The following steps are taken to determine the final codepage, in order:

              · if the specific codepage has a ++, use that codepage

              · if the data looks like UTF-8, assume it is UTF-8

              · if ----ssuubb--ccooddeeppaaggee is set to a specific codepage, use that

              · run uchardet, and if successful, use that

              · otherwise, use UUTTFF--88--BBRROOKKEENN

              The pseudo codepage UUTTFF--88--BBRROOKKEENN is used internally. If it's set, subtitles  are  inter‐
              preted  as  UTF-8  with  "Latin  1"  as  fallback  for  bytes  which are not valid UTF-8
              sequences. iconv is never involved in this mode.

                 The ----ssuubb--ffoonntt option (and many other style related ----ssuubb-- options) are ignored  when
                 ASS-subtitles are rendered, unless the ----nnoo--ssuubb--aassss option is specified.

                 This  used  to support fontconfig patterns. Starting with libass 0.13.0, this stopped
                 working.

       ----ssuubb--ffoonntt--ssiizzee==<<ssiizzee>>
              Specify the sub font size. The unit is the size in scaled pixels at a window  height  of
              720.  The  actual  pixel  size is scaled with the window height: if the window height is
              larger or smaller than 720, the actual size of the text increases or decreases as well.

              Default: 55.

       ----ssuubb--bbaacckk--ccoolloorr==<<ccoolloorr>>
              See ----ssuubb--ccoolloorr. Color used for sub text background. You can use ----ssuubb--sshhaaddooww--ooffffsseett  to
              change its size relative to the text.

       ----ssuubb--bblluurr==<<00....2200..00>>
              Gaussian blur factor. 0 means no blur applied (default).

       ----ssuubb--bboolldd==<<yyeess||nnoo>>

              NNOOTTEE::
                 ignored  when ----ssuubb--bbaacckk--ccoolloorr is specified (or more exactly: when that option is not
                 set to completely transparent).

       ----ssuubb--bboorrddeerr--ssiizzee==<<ssiizzee>>
              Size of the sub font border in scaled pixels (see ----ssuubb--ffoonntt--ssiizzee for details). A  value
              of 0 disables borders.

              Default: 3.

       ----ssuubb--ccoolloorr==<<ccoolloorr>>
              Specify the color used for unstyled text subtitles.

              The  color  is  specified  in the form rr//gg//bb, where each color component is specified as
              number in the range 0.0 to 1.0. It's also possible to specify the transparency by  using
              rr//gg//bb//aa,  where  the alpha value 0 means fully transparent, and 1.0 means opaque. If the
              alpha component is not given, the color is 100% opaque.

              Passing a single number to the option sets the sub to gray, and the form ggrraayy//aa lets you
              specify alpha additionally.

                 Examples

                 · ----ssuubb--ccoolloorr==11..00//00..00//00..00 set sub to opaque red

              Alternatively,  the  color  can  be  specified as a RGB hex triplet in the form ##RRRRGGGGBBBB,
              where each 2-digit group expresses a color value in the range 0 (0000) to  255  (FFFF).  For
              example, ##FFFF00000000 is red.  This is similar to web colors. Alpha is given with ##AAAARRRRGGGGBBBB.

       ----ssuubb--mmaarrggiinn--xx==<<ssiizzee>>
              Left  and  right  screen  margin  for the subs in scaled pixels (see ----ssuubb--ffoonntt--ssiizzee for
              details).

              This option specifies the distance of the sub to the left, as well as at which  distance
              from the right border long sub text will be broken.

              Default: 25.

       ----ssuubb--mmaarrggiinn--yy==<<ssiizzee>>

              details).

              This option specifies the vertical margins of unstyled text subtitles.  If you just want
              to raise the vertical subtitle position, use ----ssuubb--ppooss.

              Default: 22.

              Control to which corner of the screen text subtitles should be aligned to (default: cceenn‐‐
              tteerr).

              Never applied to ASS subtitles, except in ----nnoo--ssuubb--aassss mode.  Likewise,  this  does  not

              Control  how  multi  line  subs  are  justified  irrespective  of where they are aligned
              (default: aauuttoo which justifies as defined by ----ssuubb--aalliiggnn--yy).  Left justification is rec‐
              ommended to make the subs easier to read as it is easier for the eyes.

              Displacement of the sub text shadow in scaled pixels (see ----ssuubb--ffoonntt--ssiizzee for  details).
              A value of 0 disables shadows.

       ----ssuubb--ssppaacciinngg==<<ssiizzee>>
              Horizontal  sub  font  spacing  in scaled pixels (see ----ssuubb--ffoonntt--ssiizzee for details). This
              value is added to the normal letter spacing. Negative values are allowed.

              Applies filter removing subtitle additions for the deaf or hard-of-hearing (SDH).   This
              is intended for English, but may in part work for other languages too.  The intention is
              that it can be always enabled so may not remove all parts  added.   It  removes  speaker
              labels (like MAN:), upper case text in parentheses and any text in brackets.

              Default: nnoo.

              labels and text within parentheses using both lower and upper case letters.

              For every video stream, create a closed captions track (default: no). The  only  purpose
              is to make the track available for selection at the start of playback, instead of creat‐
              ing it lazily. This applies only to AATTSSCC AA5533 PPaarrtt 44 CClloosseedd CCaappttiioonnss (displayed by mpv as
              subtitle  tracks using the codec eeiiaa__660088). The CC track is marked "default" and selected
              according to the normal subtitle track selection  rules.  You  can  then  use  ----ssiidd  to
              explicitly select the correct track too.

              If the video stream contains no closed captions, or if no video is being decoded, the CC
              track will remain empty and will not show any text.

   WWiinnddooww
       ----ttiittllee==<<ssttrriinngg>>
              Set the window title. This is used for the video window, and if possible, also sets  the
              audio stream title.

              Properties are expanded. (See _P_r_o_p_e_r_t_y _E_x_p_a_n_s_i_o_n.)

              WWAARRNNIINNGG::
                 There  is a danger of this causing significant CPU usage, depending on the properties
                 used. Changing the window title is often a slow operation, and if the  title  changes
                 every frame, playback can be ruined.

       ----ssccrreeeenn==<<ddeeffaauulltt||00--3322>>
              In  multi-monitor  configurations (i.e. a single desktop that spans across multiple dis‐
              plays), this option tells mpv which screen to display the video on.

                 Note (X11)

                        This option does not work properly with all window managers. In  these  cases,
                        you  can  try  to  use ----ggeeoommeettrryy to position the window explicitly. It's also
                        possible that the window manager provides native  features  to  control  which
                        screens application windows should use.

              See also ----ffss--ssccrreeeenn.

       ----ffuullllssccrreeeenn,, ----ffss
              Fullscreen playback.

              In  multi-monitor  configurations (i.e. a single desktop that spans across multiple dis‐
              plays), this option tells mpv which screen to go fullscreen to.  If ddeeffaauulltt is  provided
              mpv  will  fallback  on  using the behavior depending on what the user provided with the
              ssccrreeeenn option.

                 Note (X11)

                        This option works properly only with window managers which understand the EWMH

                 Note (OS X)

                        aallll does not work on OS X and will behave like ccuurrrreenntt.

       ----kkeeeepp--ooppeenn==<<yyeess||nnoo||aallwwaayyss>>
              Do  not  terminate  when playing or seeking beyond the end of the file, and there is not
              next file to be played (and ----lloooopp is not used).  Instead, pause the player. When trying
              to seek beyond end of the file, the player will attempt to seek to the last frame.

              Normally,  this  will  act  like  sseett  ppaauussee yyeess on EOF, unless the ----kkeeeepp--ooppeenn--ppaauussee==nnoo
              option is set.

              The following arguments can be given:

              nnoo     If the current file ends, go to the next file or terminate.  (Default.)

              yyeess    Don't terminate if the current file is the last playlist  entry.   Equivalent  to
                     ----kkeeeepp--ooppeenn without arguments.

              aallwwaayyss Like  yyeess,  but  also applies to files before the last playlist entry. This means
                     playback will never automatically advance to the next file.

              NNOOTTEE::
                 This option is not respected when using ----ffrraammeess. Explicitly  skipping  to  the  next
                 file if the binding uses ffoorrccee will terminate playback as well.

                 Also, if errors or unusual circumstances happen, the player can quit anyway.

              Since  mpv  0.6.0,  this  doesn't  pause if there is a next file in the playlist, or the
              playlist is looped. Approximately, this will pause when the player would normally  exit,
              but  in  practice  there  are  corner  cases  in  which  this  is not the case (e.g. mmppvv
              ----kkeeeepp--ooppeenn ffiillee..mmkkvv //ddeevv//nnuullll will play file.mkv normally, then fail to open //ddeevv//nnuullll,
              then exit). (In mpv 0.8.0, aallwwaayyss was introduced, which restores the old behavior.)

       ----kkeeeepp--ooppeenn--ppaauussee==<<yyeess||nnoo>>
              If  set  to  nnoo, instead of pausing when ----kkeeeepp--ooppeenn is active, just stop at end of file
              and continue playing forward when you seek backwards until end  where  it  stops  again.
              Default: yyeess.

       ----iimmaaggee--ddiissppllaayy--dduurraattiioonn==<<sseeccoonnddss||iinnff>>
              If  the  current  file  is  an  image,  play  the  image for the given amount of seconds
              (default: 1). iinnff means the file is kept open forever (until  the  user  stops  playback
              manually).

              Unlike  ----kkeeeepp--ooppeenn,  the  player is not paused, but simply continues playback until the
              time has elapsed. (It should not use any resources during "playback".)

              This affects image files, which are defined as having only 1 video frame and  no  audio.
              The  player  may recognize certain non-images as images, for example if ----lleennggtthh is used
              to reduce the length to 1 frame, or if you seek to the last frame.

              This option does not affect the framerate used for mmff:://// or ----mmeerrggee--ffiilleess. For that, use
              ----mmff--ffppss instead.

              command-line output, and also does not duplicate the image frame when encoding. To force
              the  player  into  "dumb mode" and actually count out seconds, or to duplicate the image
              when encoding, you need to use ----ddeemmuuxxeerr==llaavvff ----ddeemmuuxxeerr--llaavvff--oo==lloooopp==11, and use  ----lleennggtthh
              or ----ffrraammeess to stop after a particular time.

              Create a video output window even if there is no video. This can be useful when pretend‐
              ing that mpv is a GUI application. Currently, the window always has  the  size  640x480,
              and is subject to ----ggeeoommeettrryy, ----aauuttooffiitt, and similar options.

              WWAARRNNIINNGG::
                 The  window  is created only after initialization (to make sure default window place‐

                 dow  size).  This  can be a problem if initialization doesn't work perfectly, such as
                 when opening URLs with bad network connection, or opening  broken  video  files.  The
                 iimmmmeeddiiaattee mode can be used to create the window always on program start, but this may
                 cause other issues.

              this is on by default, use ----nnoo--ffiitt--bboorrddeerr to make mpv try to only fit client area  with

              Adjust the initial window position or size. WW and HH set the window size in pixels. xx and
              yy  set the window position, measured in pixels from the top-left corner of the screen to
              the top-left corner of the image being displayed. If a  percentage  sign  (%%)  is  given
              after  the  argument,  it  turns  the value into a percentage of the screen size in that
              direction.  Positions are specified similar to the standard X11 ----ggeeoommeettrryy  option  for‐
              mat, in which e.g. +10-50 means "place 10 pixels from the left border and 50 pixels from
              the lower border" and "--20+-10" means "place 20 pixels beyond the right and  10  pixels
              beyond the top border".

              If an external window is specified using the ----wwiidd option, this option is ignored.

                 Note (X11)

                        This option does not work properly with all window managers.

                 Examples

                 5500::4400  Places the window at x=50, y=40.

                 5500%%::5500%%
                        Places the window in the middle of the screen.

                 110000%%::110000%%
                        Places the window at the bottom right corner of the screen.

                 5500%%    Sets the window width to half the screen width. Window height is set  so  that
                        the window has the video aspect ratio.

                 5500%%xx5500%%
                        Forces  the  window width and height to half the screen width and height. Will
                        show black borders to compensate for the video aspect ratio (with most VOs and
                        without ----nnoo--kkeeeeppaassppeecctt).

                 5500%%++1100++1100
                        Sets  the  window  to  half  the  screen  widths,  and  positions it 10 pixels
                        below/left of the top left corner of the screen.

              See also ----aauuttooffiitt and ----aauuttooffiitt--llaarrggeerr for fitting the window into a given size without
              changing aspect ratio.

       ----aauuttooffiitt==<<[[WW[[xxHH]]]]>>
              Set  the  initial  window  size to a maximum size specified by WWxxHH, without changing the
              window's aspect ratio. The size is measured in pixels, or if a number is followed  by  a
              percentage sign (%%), in percents of the screen size.

              This  option  never  changes  the  aspect  ratio of the window. If the aspect ratio mis‐
              matches, the window's size is reduced until it fits into the specified size.

              Window position is not taken into account, nor is it modified by this option (the window
              manager  still  may  place  the window differently depending on size). Use ----ggeeoommeettrryy to
              change the window position. Its effects are applied after this option.

              See ----ggeeoommeettrryy for details how this is handled with multi-monitor setups.

              Use ----aauuttooffiitt--llaarrggeerr instead if you just want to limit the maximum size of  the  window,
              rather than always forcing a window size.

              Use ----ggeeoommeettrryy if you want to force both window width and height to a specific size.

                 11000000   Set the window width to 1000 pixels, keeping aspect ratio.

                 7700%%xx6600%%
                        Make  the  window  as  large  as possible, without being wider than 70% of the
                        screen width, or higher than 60% of the screen height.

              This option behaves exactly like ----aauuttooffiitt, except the window size is  only  changed  if
              the window would be larger than the specified size.

                 Example

                 9900%%xx8800%%
                        If  the  video  is  larger  than  90% of the screen width or 80% of the screen
                        height, make the window smaller until either its width is 90% of  the  screen,
                        or its height is 80% of the screen.

              This  option behaves exactly like ----aauuttooffiitt, except that it sets the minimum size of the
              window (just as ----aauuttooffiitt--llaarrggeerr sets the maximum).

                 Example

                 550000xx550000
                        Make the window at least 500 pixels wide and 500 pixels high (depending on the
                        video  aspect  ratio,  the width or height will be larger than 500 in order to
                        keep the aspect ratio the same).

       ----wwiinnddooww--ssccaallee==<<ffaaccttoorr>>
              Resize the video window to a multiple (or fraction) of the video size.  This  option  is
              applied before ----aauuttooffiitt and other options are applied (so they override this option).

              For example, ----wwiinnddooww--ssccaallee==00..55 would show the window at half the video size.

              Change how some video outputs render the OSD and text subtitles. This  does  not  change
              appearance of the subtitles and only has performance implications. For VOs which support
              native ASS rendering (like ggppuu, vvddppaauu, ddiirreecctt33dd), this can be slightly faster or slower,
              depending on GPU drivers and hardware. For other VOs, this just makes rendering slower.

              Turns  off  the  screensaver  (or  screen blanker and similar mechanisms) at startup and
              turns it on again on exit (default: yes). The screensaver is always re-enabled when  the
              player is paused.

              This  is  not  supported on all video outputs or platforms. Sometimes it is implemented,
              but does not work (especially with Linux "desktops").

       ----wwiidd==<<IIDD>>
              This tells mpv to attach to an existing window. If a VO is selected that  supports  this
              option,  it  will use that window for video output. mpv will scale the video to the size
              of this window, and will add black bars to compensate if the aspect ratio of  the  video
              is different.

              On  X11,  the  ID is interpreted as a WWiinnddooww on X11. Unlike MPlayer/mplayer2, mpv always
              creates its own window, and sets the wid window as parent. The  window  will  always  be
              resized  to cover the parent window fully. The value 00 is interpreted specially, and mpv
              will draw directly on the root window.

              On win32, the ID is interpreted as HHWWNNDD. Pass it as value cast  to  iinnttppttrr__tt.  mpv  will
              create its own window, and set the wid window as parent, like with X11.

              will create its own sub-view. Because OSX does not support window embedding  of  foreign

              (X11 only) Control the use of NetWM protocol features.

              This may or may not help with broken window managers. This provides  some  functionality
              that  was  implemented by the now removed ----ffssttyyppee option.  Actually, it is not known to
              the developers to which degree this option was needed, so feedback is welcome.

              Specifically, yyeess will force use of NetWM fullscreen support, even if not advertised  by
              the WM. This can be useful for WMs that are broken on purpose, like XMonad. (XMonad sup‐
              posedly doesn't advertise fullscreen support, because Flash uses it. Apparently,  appli‐
              cations which want to use fullscreen anyway are supposed to either ignore the NetWM sup‐
              port hints, or provide a workaround. Shame on XMonad for deliberately breaking X  proto‐
              cols (as if X isn't bad enough already).

              By default, NetWM support is autodetected (aauuttoo).

              This option might be removed in the future.

              Size of the stream read buffer allocated for libavformat in bytes (default: 32768). Low‐

              Try harder to show embedded soft subtitles when seeking somewhere. Normally, it can hap‐
              pen  that  the  subtitle  at the seek target is not shown due to how some container file
              formats are designed. The subtitles appear only if seeking  before  or  exactly  to  the
              position  a  subtitle  first  appears.  To make this worse, subtitles are often timed to
              appear a very small amount before the associated video frame, so  that  seeking  to  the
              video frame typically does not demux the subtitle at that position.

              Enabling  this option makes the demuxer start reading data a bit before the seek target,
              so that subtitles appear correctly. Note that this makes  seeking  slower,  and  is  not
              guaranteed  to  always  work.  It only works if the subtitle is close enough to the seek
              target.

              Works with the internal Matroska demuxer only. Always enabled for absolute and hr-seeks,
              and this option changes behavior with relative or imprecise seeks only.

              You  can use the ----ddeemmuuxxeerr--mmkkvv--ssuubbttiittllee--pprreerroollll--sseeccss option to specify how much data the
              demuxer should pre-read at most in order to find subtitle packets that may overlap. Set‐
              ting  this  to  0  will effectively disable this preroll mechanism. Setting a very large
              value can make seeking very slow, and an extremely large value would  completely  reread
              the  entire  file  from  start  to seek target on every seek - seeking can become slower
              towards the end of the file. The details are messy, and the value  is  actually  rounded
              down to the cluster with the previous video keyframe.

              Some files, especially files muxed with newer mkvmerge versions, have information embed‐
              ded that can be used to determine what subtitle packets overlap with a seek  target.  In
              these  cases,  mpv  will  reduce the amount of data read to a minimum. (Although it will
              still read _a_l_l data between the cluster that contains the first wanted subtitle  packet,
              and the seek target.) If the iinnddeexx choice (which is the default) is specified, then pre‐
              rolling will be done only if this information is actually available. If this  method  is
              used,   the   maximum  amount  of  data  to  skip  can  be  additionally  controlled  by
              ----ddeemmuuxxeerr--mmkkvv--ssuubbttiittllee--pprreerroollll--sseeccss--iinnddeexx (it still uses the value of the option without
              --iinnddeexx if that is higher).

              only if hr-seek is active. It works with any demuxer, but makes seeking much slower,  as
              it has to decode audio and video data instead of just skipping over it.

              When  opening  the  file, seek to the end of it, and check what timestamp the last video
              packet has, and report that as file duration. This is strictly  for  compatibility  with
              Haali  only.  In  this  mode, it's possible that opening will be slower (especially when
              playing over http), or that behavior with broken files is much worse. So don't use  this
              option.

              The  yyeess  mode  merely uses the index and reads a small number of blocks from the end of
              the file. The ffuullll mode actually traverses the entire file and can make a reliable esti‐
              mate even without an index present (such as partial files).

              This controls how much the demuxer is allowed to buffer ahead. The demuxer will normally
              try to read ahead as much as necessary, or as much is  requested  with  ----ddeemmuuxxeerr--rreeaaddaa‐‐
              hheeaadd--sseeccss.  The option can be used to restrict the maximum readahead. This limits exces‐
              sive readahead in case of broken files or desynced playback. The demuxer will stop read‐
              ing additional packets as soon as one of the limits is reached. (The limits still can be
              slightly overstepped due to technical reasons.)

              Set these limits higher if you get a packet queue overflow warning, and you think normal
              playback would be possible with a larger packet queue.

              See ----lliisstt--ooppttiioonnss for defaults and value range. <<bbyytteessiizzee>> options accept suffixes such
              as KKiiBB and MMiiBB.

              This controls how much past data the demuxer is allowed to preserve. This is useful only
              if  the  ----ddeemmuuxxeerr--sseeeekkaabbllee--ccaacchhee option is enabled.  Unlike the forward cache, there is
              no control how many seconds are actually cached - it will simply use as much memory this
              option  allows. Setting this option to 0 will strictly disable any back buffer, but this
              will lead to the situation that the forward seek range starts after the current playback
              position (as it removes past packets that are seek points).

              Keep  in mind that other buffers in the player (like decoders) will cause the demuxer to
              cache "future" frames in the back buffer, which can skew the impression about  how  much
              data the backbuffer contains.

              See ----lliisstt--ooppttiioonnss for defaults and value range.

       ----ddeemmuuxxeerr--sseeeekkaabbllee--ccaacchhee==<<yyeess||nnoo||aauuttoo>>
              This  controls  whether  seeking  can use the demuxer cache (default: auto). If enabled,
              short seek offsets will not trigger a low level demuxer seek (which  means  for  example
              that slow network round trips or FFmpeg seek bugs can be avoided). If a seek cannot hap‐
              pen within the cached range, a low level seek will be triggered. Seeking outside of  the
              cache  will start a new cached range, but can discard the old cache range if the demuxer
              exhibits certain unsupported behavior.

              Keep in mind that some events can flush the cache or force a low level seek anyway, such
              as  switching  tracks,  or  attempting  to seek before the start or after the end of the
              file.

              The special value aauuttoo means yyeess in the same situation as  ----ccaacchhee--sseeccss  is  used  (i.e.
              when the stream appears to be a network stream or the stream cache is enabled).

       ----ddeemmuuxxeerr--tthhrreeaadd==<<yyeess||nnoo>>
              Run  the  demuxer  in a separate thread, and let it prefetch a certain amount of packets
              (default: yes). Having this enabled leads to smoother playback,  enables  features  like
              prefetching,  and  prevents that stuck network freezes the player. On the other hand, it
              can add overhead, or the background prefetching can hog CPU resources.

              Disabling this option is not recommended. Use it for debugging only.

       ----ddeemmuuxxeerr--rreeaaddaahheeaadd--sseeccss==<<sseeccoonnddss>>
              If ----ddeemmuuxxeerr--tthhrreeaadd is enabled, this controls how much the demuxer should  buffer  ahead
              in seconds (default: 1). As long as no packet has a timestamp difference higher than the
              readahead amount relative to the last packet returned to the decoder, the demuxer  keeps
              reading.

              Note  that  the  ----ccaacchhee--sseeccss option will override this value if a cache is enabled, and
              the value is larger.

              (This value tends to be fuzzy, because many file formats don't store linear timestamps.)

       ----pprreeffeettcchh--ppllaayylliisstt==<<yyeess||nnoo>>
              Prefetch next playlist entry while playback of the current  entry  is  ending  (default:
              no).  This merely opens the URL of the next playlist entry as soon as the current URL is
              fully read.

              This does nnoott work with URLs resolved by the yyoouuttuubbee--ddll wrapper, and it won't.

              This does not affect HLS (..mm33uu88 URLs) - HLS prefetching depends  on  the  demuxer  cache
              settings and is on by default.

              This  can  give  subtly  wrong  results  if per-file options are used, or if options are
              changed in the time window between prefetching start and next file played.

              This can occasionally make wrong prefetching decisions. For example,  it  can't  predict
              whether you go backwards in the playlist, and assumes you won't edit the playlist.

              Highly experimental.

              If  the  player thinks that the media is not seekable (e.g. playing from a pipe, or it's
              an http stream with a server that doesn't support range requests), seeking will be  dis‐
              abled.  This  option can forcibly enable it.  For seeks within the cache, there's a good
              chance of success.

       ----iinnppuutt--aarr--ddeellaayy

              Specify the size of the FIFO that buffers key events (default: 7). If it is  too  small,
              some  events  may  be lost. The main disadvantage of setting it to a very large value is
              that if you hold down a key triggering some particularly slow command  then  the  player
              may be unresponsive while it processes all the queued commands.

       ----iinnppuutt--tteesstt
              Input  test  mode.  Instead of executing commands on key presses, mpv will show the keys
              and the bound commands on the OSD. Has to be used with a dummy  video,  and  the  normal
              ways  to quit the player will not work (key bindings that normally quit will be shown on
              OSD only, just like any other binding). See _I_N_P_U_T_._C_O_N_F.

       ----iinnppuutt--ffiillee==<<ffiilleennaammee>>
              Read commands from the given file. Mostly useful with  a  FIFO.  Since  mpv  0.7.0  also
              understands  JSON  commands  (see  _J_S_O_N  _I_P_C),  but you can't get replies or events. Use
              ----iinnppuutt--iippcc--sseerrvveerr for something bi-directional. On MS Windows, JSON  commands  are  not
              available.

              This  can  also specify a direct file descriptor with ffdd::////NN (UNIX only).  In this case,
              JSON replies will be written if the FD is writable.

              NNOOTTEE::
                 When the given file is a FIFO mpv opens both ends, so you can do several  _e_c_h_o  _"_s_e_e_k
                 _1_0_" _> _m_p___p_i_p_e and the pipe will stay valid.

              ----nnoo--iinnppuutt--tteerrmmiinnaall  prevents  the  player  from reading key events from standard input.
              Useful when reading data from standard input. This is automatically enabled  when  --  is
              found  on the command line. There are situations where you have to set it manually, e.g.
              if you open //ddeevv//ssttddiinn (or the equivalent on your system), use stdin in  a  playlist  or
              intend to read from stdin later on via the loadfile or loadlist input commands.

              Enable the IPC support and create the listening socket at the given path.

              On  Linux and Unix, the given path is a regular filesystem path. On Windows, named pipes
              are used, so the path refers to the pipe namespace (\\\\..\\ppiippee\\<<nnaammee>>). If  the  \\\\..\\ppiippee\\
              prefix  is  missing,  mpv  will  add  it  automatically  before  creating  the  pipe, so

              Permit  mpv  to receive pointer events reported by the video output driver. Necessary to
              use the OSC, or to select the buttons in DVD menus.  Support depends on the VO in use.

              (Cocoa  and Windows only) Use the right Alt key as Alt Gr to produce special characters.
              If disabled, count the right Alt as an Alt modifier key. Enabled by default.

              Disable all keyboard input on for VOs which can't participate in proper  keyboard  input
              dispatching. May not affect all VOs. Generally useful for embedding only.

              On  X11,  a sub-window with input enabled grabs all keyboard input as long as it is 1. a
              child of a focused window, and 2. the mouse is inside of the sub-window.  It  can  steal
              away  all keyboard input from the application embedding the mpv window, and on the other
              hand, the mpv window will receive no input if the mouse is outside of  the  mpv  window,
              even  though  mpv  has  focus.  Modern toolkits work around this weird X11 behavior, but
              naively embedding foreign windows breaks it.

              The only way to handle this reasonably is using the XEmbed protocol, which was  designed
              to  solve these problems. GTK provides GGttkkSSoocckkeett, which supports XEmbed. Qt doesn't seem
              to provide anything working in newer versions.

              If the embedder supports XEmbed, input should work with default settings and  with  this
              option  disabled.  Note  that iinnppuutt--ddeeffaauulltt--bbiinnddiinnggss is disabled by default in libmpv as
              well - it should be enabled if you want the mpv default key bindings.

              (This option was renamed from ----iinnppuutt--xx1111--kkeeyybbooaarrdd.)

   OOSSDD
       ----oosscc,, ----nnoo--oosscc

       ----nnoo--oossdd--bbaarr,, ----oossdd--bbaarr
              Disable display of the OSD bar.

              You can configure this on a per-command basis in input.conf  using  oossdd--  prefixes,  see
              IInnppuutt CCoommmmaanndd PPrreeffiixxeess. If you want to disable the OSD completely, use ----oossdd--lleevveell==00.

              Specify the OSD font size. See ----ssuubb--ffoonntt--ssiizzee for details.

              Default: 55.

       ----oossdd--mmssgg11==<<ssttrriinngg>>
              Show this string as message on OSD with OSD level 1 (visible by default).   The  message
              will be visible by default, and as long as no other message covers it, and the OSD level
              isn't changed (see ----oossdd--lleevveell).  Expands properties; see _P_r_o_p_e_r_t_y _E_x_p_a_n_s_i_o_n.

       ----oossdd--mmssgg22==<<ssttrriinngg>>
              Similar to ----oossdd--mmssgg11, but for OSD level 2. If this is an empty string  (default),  then
              the playback time is shown.

       ----oossdd--mmssgg33==<<ssttrriinngg>>
              Similar  to  ----oossdd--mmssgg11, but for OSD level 3. If this is an empty string (default), then
              the playback time, duration, and some more information is shown.

              This is used for the sshhooww--pprrooggrreessss command (by default mapped to PP), and when seeking if
              enabled  with  ----oossdd--oonn--sseeeekk  or  by oossdd-- prefixes in input.conf (see IInnppuutt CCoommmmaanndd PPrree‐‐

              ----oossdd--ssttaattuuss--mmssgg is a legacy equivalent (but with a minor difference).

              Show a custom string during playback instead of the standard status  text.   This  over‐
              rides  the  status text used for ----oossdd--lleevveell==33, when using the sshhooww--pprrooggrreessss command (by
              default mapped to PP), and when seeking if enabled with ----oossdd--oonn--sseeeekk or oossdd-- prefixes in
              input.conf (see IInnppuutt CCoommmmaanndd PPrreeffiixxeess). Expands properties. See _P_r_o_p_e_r_t_y _E_x_p_a_n_s_i_o_n.

              This  option  has been replaced with ----oossdd--mmssgg33. The only difference is that this option
              implicitly includes $${{oossdd--ssyymm--cccc}}. This option is ignored if ----oossdd--mmssgg33 is not empty.

              Show a message on OSD when playback starts. The string is expanded for properties,  e.g.
              ----oossdd--ppllaayyiinngg--mmssgg==''ffiillee::  $${{ffiilleennaammee}}''  will  show the message ffiillee:: followed by a space
              and the currently played filename.

       ----oossdd--bbaarr--ww==<<11--110000>>
              Width of the OSD bar, in percentage of the screen width (default: 75).  A  value  of  50
              means the bar is half the screen wide.

       ----oossdd--bbaarr--hh==<<00..11--5500>>

              See ----oossdd--ccoolloorr. Color used for the OSD font border.

              NNOOTTEE::
                 ignored  when ----oossdd--bbaacckk--ccoolloorr is specified (or more exactly: when that option is not
                 set to completely transparent).

       ----oossdd--bboorrddeerr--ssiizzee==<<ssiizzee>>
              Size of the OSD font border in scaled pixels (see ----ssuubb--ffoonntt--ssiizzee for details). A  value
              of 0 disables borders.

              Default: 3.

       ----oossdd--ccoolloorr==<<ccoolloorr>>
              Specify the color used for OSD.  See ----ssuubb--ccoolloorr for details.

       ----oossdd--mmaarrggiinn--xx==<<ssiizzee>>
              Left and right screen margin for the OSD  in  scaled  pixels  (see  ----ssuubb--ffoonntt--ssiizzee  for
              details).

              This  option specifies the distance of the OSD to the left, as well as at which distance
              from the right border long OSD text will be broken.

              Default: 25.

       ----oossdd--mmaarrggiinn--yy==<<ssiizzee>>

              details).

              This option specifies the vertical margins of the OSD.

              Default: 22.

       ----oossdd--ssccaallee==<<ffaaccttoorr>>
              OSD font size multiplier, multiplied with ----oossdd--ffoonntt--ssiizzee value.

       ----oossdd--ssccaallee--bbyy--wwiinnddooww==<<yyeess||nnoo>>
              Whether  to  scale  the  OSD  with  the window size (default: yes). If this is disabled,
              ----oossdd--ffoonntt--ssiizzee and other OSD options that use scaled pixels are always in  actual  pix‐
              els. The effect is that changing the window size won't change the OSD font size.

              Displacement  of  the  OSD  shadow in scaled pixels (see ----ssuubb--ffoonntt--ssiizzee for details). A
              value of 0 disables shadows.

              Default: 0.

       ----oossdd--ssppaacciinngg==<<ssiizzee>>
              Horizontal OSD/sub font spacing in scaled pixels (see ----ssuubb--ffoonntt--ssiizzee for details). This
              value is added to the normal letter spacing. Negative values are allowed.

              Default: 0.

       ----vviiddeeoo--oossdd==<<yyeess||nnoo>>
              Enabled OSD rendering on the video window (default: yes). This can be used in situations
              where terminal OSD is preferred. If you just want to  disable  all  OSD  rendering,  use
              ----oossdd--lleevveell==00.

              It  does  not  affect  subtitles  or overlays created by scripts (in particular, the OSC
              needs to be disabled with ----nnoo--oosscc).

              This option is somewhat experimental and could be replaced by another mechanism  in  the
              future.

              Tag screenshots with the appropriate colorspace.

              Note that not all formats are supported.

              Default: nnoo.

              If  possible,  write  screenshots with a bit depth similar to the source video (default:
              yes). This is interesting in particular for PNG, as this sometimes triggers  writing  16
              bit  PNGs  with  huge  file sizes. This will also include an unused alpha channel in the
              resulting files if 16 bit is used.

       ----ssccrreeeennsshhoott--tteemmppllaattee==<<tteemmppllaattee>>
              Specify the filename template used to save screenshots. The template specifies the file‐
              name  without  file  extension, and can contain format specifiers, which will be substi‐
              tuted when taking a screenshot.  By default, the template is mmppvv--sshhoott%%nn,  which  results
              in filenames like mmppvv--sshhoott00001122..ppnngg for example.

              The template can start with a relative or absolute path, in order to specify a directory
              location where screenshots should be saved.

              If the final screenshot filename points to an already existing file, the file  will  not
              be overwritten. The screenshot will either not be saved, or if the template contains %%nn,
              saved using different, newly generated filename.

              Allowed format specifiers:

              %%[[##]][[00XX]]nn
                     A sequence number, padded with zeros to length X (default: 04). E.g.  passing the
                     format  %%0044nn  will  yield 00001122 on the 12th screenshot.  The number is incremented
                     every time a screenshot is taken or if the file already exists. The length XX must
                     be  in the range 0-9. With the optional # sign, mpv will use the lowest available
                     number. For example, if you take three screenshots--0001, 0002, 0003--and  delete
                     the  first  two, the next two screenshots will not be 0004 and 0005, but 0001 and
                     0002 again.

              %%ff     Filename of the currently played video.

              %%FF     Same as %%ff, but strip the file extension, including the dot.

              %%xx     Directory path of the currently played video. If the video is not on the filesys‐
                     tem (but e.g. hhttttpp::////), this expand to an empty string.

              %%XX{{ffaallllbbaacckk}}
                     Same  as  %%xx, but if the video file is not on the filesystem, return the fallback
                     string inside the {{......}}.

              %%pp     Current playback time, in the same format as used in the OSD.  The  result  is  a
                     string  of the form "HH:MM:SS". For example, if the video is at the time position
                     5 minutes and 34 seconds, %%pp will be replaced with "00:05:34".

              %%PP     Similar to %%pp, but extended with the playback time in milliseconds.  It  is  for‐
                     matted  as  "HH:MM:SS.mmm", with "mmm" being the millisecond part of the playback
                     time.

                     NNOOTTEE::
                        This is a simple way for getting unique per-frame timestamps.  (Frame  numbers
                        would  be  more  intuitive, but are not easily implementable because container
                        formats usually use time stamps for identifying frames.)

              %%wwXX    Specify the current playback  time  using  the  format  string  XX.   %%pp  is  like
                     %%wwHH::%%wwMM::%%wwSS, and %%PP is like %%wwHH::%%wwMM::%%wwSS..%%wwTT.

              %%ttXX    Specify  the  current  local  date/time using the format XX. This format specifier
                     uses the UNIX ssttrrffttiimmee(()) function internally, and inserts the result  of  passing
                     "%X" to ssttrrffttiimmee. For example, %%ttmm will insert the number of the current month as
                     number. You have to use multiple %%ttXX specifiers to build a full date/time string.

              %%{{pprroopp[[::ffaallllbbaacckk tteexxtt]]}}
                     Insert the value of the input property 'prop'. E.g. %%{{ffiilleennaammee}} is  the  same  as
                     %%ff.  If  the  property  does  not  exist  or  is  not available, an error text is
                     inserted, unless a fallback is specified.

              %%%%     Replaced with the %% character itself.

              ----ssccrreeeennsshhoott--tteemmppllaattee.  If  the  template filename is already absolute, the directory is
              ignored.

              If the directory does not exist, it is created on the first screenshot. If it is  not  a
              directory, an error is generated when trying to write a screenshot.

              This option is not set by default, and thus will write screenshots to the directory from
              which mpv was started. In pseudo-gui mode (see _P_S_E_U_D_O _G_U_I _M_O_D_E),  this  is  set  to  the

              Write  JPEG  files with the same chroma subsampling as the video (default: yes). If dis‐

              Set the PNG compression level. Higher means better compression.  This  will  affect  the
              file  size  of  the written screenshot file and the time it takes to write a screenshot.
              Too high compression might occupy enough CPU time to interrupt playback. The default  is
              7.

              Set  the filter applied prior to PNG compression. 0 is none, 1 is "sub", 2 is "up", 3 is
              "average", 4 is "Paeth", and 5 is "mixed". This affects the level  of  compression  that
              can  be achieved. For most images, "mixed" achieves the best compression ratio, hence it
              is the default.

              Enable/disable normalization if surround audio is downmixed to stereo (default: no).  If
              this  is  disabled, downmix can cause clipping. If it's enabled, the output might be too
              quiet. It depends on the source audio.

              Technically, this changes the nnoorrmmaalliizzee suboption  of  the  llaavvrrrreessaammppllee  audio  filter,
              which performs the downmixing.

              If  downmix  happens outside of mpv for some reason, or in the decoder (decoder downmix‐
              ing), or in the audio output (system mixer), this has no effect.

              Limit maximum size of audio frames filtered at once, in ms (default:  40).   The  output
              size  size is limited in order to make resample speed changes react faster. This is nec‐
              essary especially if decoders or filters output very large frame sizes (like some  loss‐
              less  codecs or some DRC filters).  This option does not affect the resampling algorithm

              Control verbosity directly for each module. The aallll module changes the verbosity of  all

       ----ttvv--aammooddee==<<00--33>>
              Choose an audio mode:

       ----ttvv--ffoorrcceecchhaann==<<11--22>>
              By default, the count of recorded audio channels is determined automatically by querying
              the  audio  mode  from  the  TV  card.  This option allows forcing stereo/mono recording
              regardless of the amode option and the values returned by v4l.  This  can  be  used  for
              troubleshooting when the TV card is unable to report the current audio mode.

       ----ttvv--aaddeevviiccee==<<vvaalluuee>>

              These options set parameters of the mixer on the video capture card.  They will have  no
              effect,  if  your  card  does not have one. For v4l2 50 maps to the default value of the

              Set gain control for video devices (usually webcams) to the desired value and switch off
              automatic  control.  A  value of 0 enables automatic control. If this option is omitted,
              gain control will not be modified.

       ----ttvv--iimmmmeeddiiaatteemmooddee==<<bbooooll>>
              A value of 0 means capture and buffer audio and video together. A value of  1  (default)
              means to do video capture only and let the audio go through a loopback cable from the TV
              card to the sound card.

       ----ttvv--mmjjppeegg
              Use hardware MJPEG compression (if the card supports it). When using this option, you do
              not  need  to specify the width and height of the output window, because mpv will deter‐
              mine it automatically from the decimation value (see below).

       ----ttvv--ssccaann--aauuttoossttaarrtt

              Specify delay in seconds before switching to next channel (default: 0.5).  Lower  values
              will cause faster scanning, but can detect inactive TV channels as active.

              Threshold  value  for  the  signal  strength  (in  percent),  as  reported by the device
              (default: 50). A signal strength higher than this value will indicate that the currently
              scanning channel is active.

              Set  the  size of the cache in kilobytes, disable it with nnoo, or automatically enable it
              if needed with aauuttoo (default: aauuttoo).  With aauuttoo, the cache will usually be  enabled  for
              network  streams, using the size set by ----ccaacchhee--ddeeffaauulltt. With yyeess, the cache will always
              be enabled with the size set by ----ccaacchhee--ddeeffaauulltt (unless the stream cannot be cached,  or
              ----ccaacchhee--ddeeffaauulltt disables caching).

              May  be  useful  when playing files from slow media, but can also have negative effects,
              especially with file formats that require a lot of seeking, such as MP4.

              Note that half the cache size will be used to allow fast seeking back. This is also  the
              reason  why  a  full cache is usually not reported as 100% full.  The cache fill display
              does not include the part of the cache reserved for seeking  back.  The  actual  maximum
              percentage will usually be the ratio between readahead and backbuffer sizes.

       ----ccaacchhee--ddeeffaauulltt==<<kkBByytteess||nnoo>>
              Set  the size of the cache in kilobytes (default: 10000 KB). Using nnoo will not automati‐
              cally enable the cache e.g. when playing from a network stream. Note that using  ----ccaacchhee
              will always override this option.

       ----ccaacchhee--iinniittiiaall==<<kkBByytteess>>
              Playback  will  start when the cache has been filled up with this many kilobytes of data
              (default: 0).

       ----ccaacchhee--sseeeekk--mmiinn==<<kkBByytteess>>
              If a seek is to be made to a position within <<kkBByytteess>> of the cache size from the current
              position, mpv will wait for the cache to be filled to this position rather than perform‐
              ing a stream seek (default: 500).

              This matters for small forward seeks. With slow streams (especially HTTP streams)  there
              is  a  tradeoff between skipping the data between current position and seek destination,
              or performing an actual seek. Depending on the  situation,  either  of  these  might  be
              slower than the other method.  This option allows control over this.

       ----ccaacchhee--bbaacckkbbuuffffeerr==<<kkBByytteess>>
              Size  of  the  cache  back  buffer (default: 10000 KB). This will add to the total cache
              size, and reserved the amount for seeking back. The reserved amount will not be used for
              readahead, and instead preserves already read data to enable fast seeking back.

       ----ccaacchhee--ffiillee==<<TTMMPP||ppaatthh>>
              Create a cache file on the filesystem.

              There are two ways of using this:

              1. Passing  a  path  (a filename). The file will always be overwritten. When the general
                 cache is enabled, this file cache will be used to store whatever  is  read  from  the
                 source stream.

                 This  will  always overwrite the cache file, and you can't use an existing cache file
                 to resume playback of a stream. (Technically, mpv wouldn't even know which blocks  in
                 the file are valid and which not.)

                 The  resulting  file  will not necessarily contain all data of the source stream. For
                 example, if you seek, the parts that were skipped over  are  never  read  and  conse‐
                 quently  are  not written to the cache. The skipped over parts are filled with zeros.
                 This means that the cache file doesn't necessarily correspond to a full  download  of
                 the source stream.

                 Both of these issues could be improved if there is any user interest.

                    Causes random corruption when used with ordered chapters or with ----aauuddiioo--ffiillee.

              2. Passing the string TTMMPP. This will not be interpreted as filename.  Instead, an invis‐
                 ible temporary file is created. It depends on your C library where this file is  cre‐
                 ated  (usually  //ttmmpp//),  and  whether  filename is visible (the ttmmppffiillee(()) function is
                 used). On some systems, automatic deletion of the cache file might not be guaranteed.

                 If you want to use a file cache, this mode is recommended, because it  doesn't  break
                 ordered  chapters or ----aauuddiioo--ffiillee. These modes open multiple cache streams, and using
                 the same file for them obviously clashes.

              See also: ----ccaacchhee--ffiillee--ssiizzee.

       ----ccaacchhee--ffiillee--ssiizzee==<<kkBByytteess>>
              Maximum size of the file created with ----ccaacchhee--ffiillee. For read accesses above  this  size,
              the cache is simply not used.

              Keep in mind that some use-cases, like playing ordered chapters with cache enabled, will
              actually create multiple cache files, each of which will use up to this much disk space.

              (Default: 1048576, 1 GB.)

       ----nnoo--ccaacchhee
              Turn off input stream caching. See ----ccaacchhee.

       ----ccaacchhee--sseeccss==<<sseeccoonnddss>>
              How many seconds of audio/video to prefetch if the cache is active. This  overrides  the
              ----ddeemmuuxxeerr--rreeaaddaahheeaadd--sseeccss  option  if  and  only if the cache is enabled and the value is
              larger. The default value is set to something very high, so the actually achieved reada‐
              head will usually be limited by the value of the ----ddeemmuuxxeerr--mmaaxx--bbyytteess option.

       ----ccaacchhee--ppaauussee==<<yyeess||nnoo>>
              Whether the player should automatically pause when the cache runs out of data and stalls
              decoding/playback (default: yes). If enabled, it will pause and unpause once  more  data
              is available, aka "buffering".

       ----ccaacchhee--ppaauussee--wwaaiitt==<<sseeccoonnddss>>
              Number  of  seconds the packet cache should have buffered before starting playback again
              if "buffering" was entered (default: 1). This can be used to control how long the player
              rebuffers  if  ----ccaacchhee--ppaauussee is enabled, and the demuxer underruns. If the given time is
              higher than the maximum set with ----ccaacchhee--sseeccss or  ----ddeemmuuxxeerr--rreeaaddaahheeaadd--sseeccss, or prefetch‐
              ing ends before that for some other reason (like file end), playback resumes earlier.

       ----ccaacchhee--ppaauussee--iinniittiiaall==<<yyeess||nnoo>>
              Enter  "buffering"  mode  before  starting  playback  (default: no). This can be used to
              ensure playback starts smoothly, in exchange for waiting some time to  prefetch  network
              data  (as  controlled  by ----ccaacchhee--ppaauussee--wwaaiitt). For example, some common behavior is that
              playback starts, but network caches immediately underrun when trying to decode more data
              as playback progresses.

              Another  thing  that can happen is that the network prefetching is so CPU demanding (due
              to demuxing in the background) that playback drops frames at first. In these  cases,  it
              helps  enabling  this option, and setting ----ccaacchhee--sseeccss and ----ccaacchhee--ppaauussee--wwaaiitt to roughly
              the same value.

              This option also triggers when playback is restarted after seeking.

       ----hhttttpp--pprrooxxyy==<<pprrooxxyy>>
              URL of the HTTP/HTTPS proxy. If this is set, the hhttttpp__pprrooxxyy environment is ignored.  The
              nnoo__pprrooxxyy  environment variable is still respected. This option is silently ignored if it
              does not start with hhttttpp::////. Proxies are not used for https URLs.  Setting  this  option
              does not try to make the ytdl script use the proxy.

       ----ttllss--ccaa--ffiillee==<<ffiilleennaammee>>

       ----ttllss--cceerrtt--ffiillee

       ----rreeffeerrrreerr==<<ssttrriinngg>>

              Specify  the network timeout in seconds. This affects at least HTTP. The special value 0
              (default) uses the FFmpeg/Libav defaults. If a protocol is used which does  not  support
              timeouts, this option is silently ignored.

              WWAARRNNIINNGG::
                 This  breaks  the  RTSP  protocol,  because  of inconsistent FFmpeg API regarding its
                 internal timeout option. Not only does the RTSP timeout option accept different units
                 (seconds  instead  of microseconds, causing mpv to pass it huge values), it will also
                 overflow FFmpeg internal calculations. The worst is that merely  setting  the  option
                 will  put  RTSP  into  listening  mode, which breaks any client uses. Do not use this
                 option with RTSP URLs.

              If  HLS  streams  are played, this option controls what streams are selected by default.
              The option allows the following parameters:

              nnoo     Don't do anything special. Typically, this will simply pick the first audio/video
                     streams it can find.

              mmiinn    Pick the streams with the lowest bitrate.

              mmaaxx    Same, but highest bitrate. (Default.)

              Additionally, if the option is a number, the stream with the highest rate equal or below
              the option value is selected.

              The bitrate as used is sent by the server, and there's no guarantee it's actually  mean‐
              ingful.

   DDVVBB
       ----ddvvbbiinn--ccaarrdd==<<11--44>>

              Instructs  mpv to read the channels list from <<ffiilleennaammee>>. The default is in the mpv con‐
              figuration   directory    (usually    ~~//..ccoonnffiigg//mmppvv)    with    the    filename    cchhaann‐‐

              resort.  For DVB-S/2 cards, a VDR 1.7.x format channel list is recommended as it  allows
              tuning  to  DVB-S2  channels,  enabling  subtitles  and  decoding the PMT (which largely
              improves the demuxing).  Classic mplayer format channel lists are still supported (with‐
              out  these improvements), and for other card types, only limited VDR format channel list
              support is implemented (patches welcome).  For channels with dynamic  PID  switching  or
              incomplete  cchhaannnneellss..ccoonnff,  ----ddvvbbiinn--ffuullll--ttrraannssppoonnddeerr  or  the  magic PID 88119922 are recom‐
              mended.

       ----ddvvbbiinn--ttiimmeeoouutt==<<11--3300>>
              Maximum number of seconds to wait when trying to  tune  a  frequency  before  giving  up
              (default: 30).

       ----ddvvbbiinn--ffuullll--ttrraannssppoonnddeerr==<<yyeess||nnoo>>
              Apply  no  filters  on program PIDs, only tune to frequency and pass full transponder to
              demuxer.  The player frontend selects the streams from the full TS in this case, so  the
              program  which  is  shown initially may not match the chosen channel.  Switching between
              the programs is possible by cycling the pprrooggrraamm property.  This is useful to record mul‐
              tiple  programs  on a single transponder, or to work around issues in the cchhaannnneellss..ccoonnff.
              It is also recommended to use this for channels which switch PIDs on-the-fly,  e.g.  for
              regional news.

              Don't  read or set the channel map of the ALSA device - only request the required number
              of channels, and then pass the audio as-is to it. This option most likely should not  be
              used.  It  can be useful for debugging, or for static setups with a specially engineered
              ALSA configuration  (in  this  case  you  should  always  force  the  same  layout  with
              ----aauuddiioo--cchhaannnneellss,  or  it will work only for files which use the layout implicit to your

              Set the requested buffer time in microseconds. A value of 0  skips  requesting  anything
              from  the  ALSA  API. This and the ----aallssaa--ppeerriiooddss option uses the ALSA nneeaarr functions to
              set the requested parameters. If doing so results in an empty configuration set, setting
              these parameters is skipped.

              Both options control the buffer size. A low buffer size can lead to higher CPU usage and
              audio dropouts, while a high buffer size can lead to higher latency  in  volume  changes
              and other filtering.

                     but very good quality. The radius can be controlled with ssccaallee--rraaddiiuuss. Increasing
                     the radius makes the filter sharper but adds more ringing.

                     (This filter is an alias for jjiinncc-windowed jjiinncc)

              eewwaa__llaanncczzoosssshhaarrpp
                     A slightly sharpened version of ewa_lanczos, preconfigured to use an ideal radius
                     and parameter. If your hardware can run it, this is probably what you should  use
                     by default.

              mmiittcchheellll
                     Mitchell-Netravali.  The  BB  and  CC parameters can be set with ----ssccaallee--ppaarraamm11 and
                     ----ssccaallee--ppaarraamm22. This filter is very good at downscaling (see ----ddssccaallee).

              oovveerrssaammppllee
                     A version of nearest neighbour that (naively) oversamples pixels, so that  pixels
                     overlapping  edges get linearly interpolated instead of rounded. This essentially
                     removes the small imperfections and judder artifacts caused by  nearest-neighbour
                     interpolation,  in exchange for adding some blur. This filter is good at temporal
                     interpolation, and also known as "smoothmotion" (see ----ttssccaallee).

              lliinneeaarr A ----ttssccaallee filter.

              There are some more filters, but most are not as useful. For a complete list, pass  hheellpp
              as value, e.g.:

                 mpv --scale=help

       ----ccssccaallee==<<ffiilltteerr>>
              As  ----ssccaallee,  but  for interpolating chroma information. If the image is not subsampled,
              this option is ignored entirely.

       ----ddssccaallee==<<ffiilltteerr>>
              Like ----ssccaallee, but apply these filters on downscaling instead. If this option  is  unset,
              the filter implied by ----ssccaallee will be applied.

       ----ttssccaallee==<<ffiilltteerr>>
              The  filter  used  for  interpolating  the  temporal axis (frames). This is only used if
              ----iinntteerrppoollaattiioonn is enabled. The only valid choices for ----ttssccaallee are  separable  convolu‐
              tion filters (use ----ttssccaallee==hheellpp to get a list). The default is mmiittcchheellll.

              Common  ----ttssccaallee choices include oovveerrssaammppllee, lliinneeaarr, ccaattmmuullll__rroomm, mmiittcchheellll, ggaauussssiiaann, or
              bbiiccuubbiicc. These are listed in increasing order  of  smoothness/blurriness,  with  bbiiccuubbiicc
              being the smoothest/blurriest and oovveerrssaammppllee being the sharpest/least smooth.

              Set filter parameters. Ignored if the filter is not tunable. Currently, this affects the
              following filter parameters:

              bbccsspplliinnee
                     Spline parameters (BB and CC). Defaults to 0.5 for both.

              ggaauussssiiaann
                     Scale parameter (tt). Increasing this makes the result blurrier.  Defaults to 1.

              oovveerrssaammppllee
                     Minimum distance to an edge before interpolation is used. Setting this to 0  will
                     always  interpolate edges, whereas setting it to 0.5 will never interpolate, thus
                     behaving as if the regular nearest neighbour algorithm was used. Defaults to 0.0.

       ----ssccaallee--bblluurr==<<vvaalluuee>>,,  ----ssccaallee--wwbblluurr==<<vvaalluuee>>,,  ----ccssccaallee--bblluurr==<<vvaalluuee>>,,   ----ccssccaallee--wwbblluurr==<<vvaalluuee>>,,
       ----ddssccaallee--bblluurr==<<vvaalluuee>>,, ----ddssccaallee--wwbblluurr==<<vvaalluuee>>,, ----ttssccaallee--bblluurr==<<vvaalluuee>>,, ----ttssccaallee--wwbblluurr==<<vvaalluuee>>
              Kernel/window  scaling  factor  (also known as a blur factor). Decreasing this makes the
              result sharper, increasing it makes it blurrier (default 0). If set to 0,  the  kernel's
              preferred  blur  factor  is  used. Note that setting this too low (eg. 0.5) leads to bad
              results. It's generally recommended to stick to values between 0.8 and 1.2.

       ----ssccaallee--ccllaammpp==<<00..00--11..00>>,, ----ccssccaallee--ccllaammpp,, ----ddssccaallee--ccllaammpp,, ----ttssccaallee--ccllaammpp
              Specifies  a  weight  bias  to   multiply   into   negative   coefficients.   Specifying
              ----ssccaallee--ccllaammpp==11 has the effect of removing negative weights completely, thus effectively
              clamping the value range to [0-1]. Values between 0.0 and 1.0 can be specified to  apply
              only  a  moderate  diminishment  of  negative  weights.  This  is  especially useful for
              ----ttssccaallee, where it reduces excessive ringing artifacts in  the  temporal  domain  (which
              typically manifest themselves as short flashes or fringes of black, mostly around moving
              edges) in exchange for potentially adding more blur. The default for  ----ttssccaallee--ccllaammpp  is
              1.0, the others default to 0.0.

              Cut  off  the filter kernel prematurely once the value range drops below this threshold.
              Doing so allows more aggressive pruning of skippable coefficients by disregarding  parts
              of  the  LUT which are effectively zeroed out by the window function. Only affects polar
              (EWA) filters. The default is 0.001 for each, which is perceptually transparent but pro‐
              vides a 10%-20% speedup, depending on the exact radius and filter kernel chosen.

       ppeerr==<<vvaalluuee>>
              Kernel/window  taper  factor. Increasing this flattens the filter function.  Value range
              is 0 to 1. A value of 0 (the default) means no flattening, a value of 1 makes the filter
              completely  flat  (equivalent to a box function).  Values in between mean that some por‐
              tion will be flat and the actual filter function will be  squeezed  into  the  space  in
              between.

       ----ssccaallee--rraaddiiuuss==<<vvaalluuee>>,,            ----ccssccaallee--rraaddiiuuss==<<vvaalluuee>>,,            ----ddssccaallee--rraaddiiuuss==<<vvaalluuee>>,,
       ----ttssccaallee--rraaddiiuuss==<<vvaalluuee>>
              Set radius for tunable filters, must be a float number between 0.5 and 16.0. Defaults to
              the  filter's  preferred  radius  if not specified. Doesn't work for every scaler and VO
              combination.

              Note that depending on filter implementation details and video scaling ratio, the radius
              that actually being used might be different (most likely being increased a bit).

       iinngg==<<vvaalluuee>>
              Set the antiringing strength. This tries to eliminate ringing, but can  introduce  other
              artifacts  in the process. Must be a float number between 0.0 and 1.0. The default value
              of 0.0 disables antiringing entirely.

              Note that this doesn't affect the special filters bbiilliinneeaarr and bbiiccuubbiicc__ffaasstt, nor does it
              affect any polar (EWA) scalers.

              (Advanced users only) Choose a custom windowing function for the  kernel.   Defaults  to
              the  filter's  preferred  window if unset. Use ----ssccaallee--wwiinnddooww==hheellpp to get a list of sup‐
              ported windowing functions.

              (Advanced  users  only)  Configure  the  parameter  for  the  window  function  given by
              ----ssccaallee--wwiinnddooww etc. Ignored if the window is not tunable. Currently,  this  affects  the
              following window parameters:

              kkaaiisseerr Window parameter (alpha). Defaults to 6.33.

              bbllaacckkmmaann
                     Window parameter (alpha). Defaults to 0.16.

              ggaauussssiiaann
                     Scale parameter (t). Increasing this makes the window wider. Defaults to 1.

       ----ssccaalleerr--lluutt--ssiizzee==<<44....1100>>
              Set  the  size of the lookup texture for scaler kernels (default: 6). The actual size of
              the texture is 22^^NN for an option value of NN. So the lookup texture with the default set‐
              ting uses 64 samples.

              All  weights  are  linearly  interpolated  from those samples, so increasing the size of
              lookup table might improve the accuracy of scaler.

       ----ssccaalleerr--rreessiizzeess--oonnllyy
              Disable the scaler if the video image is not resized. In that  case,  bbiilliinneeaarr  is  used
              instead  of  whatever is set with ----ssccaallee. Bilinear will reproduce the source image per‐
              fectly if no scaling is performed.  Enabled by default.  Note  that  this  option  never
              affects ----ccssccaallee.

       ----lliinneeaarr--ssccaalliinngg
              Scale  in  linear light. It should only be used with a ----ffbboo--ffoorrmmaatt that has at least 16
              bit precision. This option has no effect on HDR content.

       ----ccoorrrreecctt--ddoowwnnssccaalliinngg
              When using convolution based filters, extend the filter size when downscaling. Increases
              quality, but reduces performance while downscaling.

              This  will  perform  slightly  sub-optimally for anamorphic video (but still better than
              without it) since it will extend the size to match only the milder of the scale  factors
              between the axes.

       ----iinntteerrppoollaattiioonn
              Reduce  stuttering  caused by mismatches in the video fps and display refresh rate (also
              known as judder).

              WWAARRNNIINNGG::
                 This requires setting the ----vviiddeeoo--ssyynncc option to one of the  ddiissppllaayy--  modes,  or  it
                 will be silently disabled.  This was not required before mpv 0.14.0.

              This  essentially  attempts  to  interpolate the missing frames by convoluting the video
              along the temporal axis. The filter used can be controlled using the ----ttssccaallee setting.

       ----iinntteerrppoollaattiioonn--tthhrreesshhoolldd==<<00....11,,--11>>
              Threshold below which frame ratio interpolation gets disabled (default: 00..00000011). This is
              calculated  as  aabbss((ddiisspphhzz//vvffppss -- 11)) << tthhrreesshhoolldd, where vvffppss is the speed-adjusted video
              FPS, and ddiisspphhzz the display refresh rate. (The speed-adjusted video FPS is roughly equal
              to  the normal video FPS, but with slowdown and speedup applied. This matters if you use
              ----vviiddeeoo--ssyynncc==ddiissppllaayy--rreessaammppllee to make video run synchronously to the display FPS, or  if
              you change the ssppeeeedd property.)

              The  default  is  intended to almost always enable interpolation if the playback rate is
              even slightly different from the display refresh rate. But note that  if  you  use  e.g.
              ----vviiddeeoo--ssyynncc==ddiissppllaayy--vvddrroopp,  small  deviations in the rate can disable interpolation and
              introduce a discontinuity every other minute.

              Set this to --11 to disable this logic.

       ----ooppeennggll--ppbboo
              Enable use of PBOs. On some drivers this can be faster, especially if the  source  video
              size  is  huge (e.g. so called "4K" video). On other drivers it might be slower or cause
              latency issues.

       ----ddiitthheerr--ddeepptthh==<<NN||nnoo||aauuttoo>>
              Set dither target depth to N. Default: no.

              nnoo     Disable any dithering done by mpv.

              aauuttoo   Automatic selection. If output bit depth cannot be detected, 8 bits per component
                     are assumed.

              88      Dither to 8 bit output.

              Note that the depth of the connected video display device cannot be detected. Often, LCD
              panels will do dithering on their own, which conflicts with this  option  and  leads  to
              ugly output.

       ----ddiitthheerr--ssiizzee--ffrruuiitt==<<22--88>>
              Set the size of the dither matrix (default: 6). The actual size of the matrix is ((22^^NN)) xx
              ((22^^NN)) for an option value of NN, so a value of 6 gives a size of  64x64.  The  matrix  is
              generated at startup time, and a large matrix can take rather long to compute (seconds).

              Used in ----ddiitthheerr==ffrruuiitt mode only.

       ----ddiitthheerr==<<ffrruuiitt||oorrddeerreedd||nnoo>>
              Select  dithering  algorithm (default: fruit). (Normally, the ----ddiitthheerr--ddeepptthh option con‐
              trols whether dithering is enabled.)

       ----tteemmppoorraall--ddiitthheerr
              Enable temporal dithering. (Only active  if  dithering  is  enabled  in  general.)  This
              changes between 8 different dithering patterns on each frame by changing the orientation
              of the tiled dithering matrix. Unfortunately, this can lead to flicker on LCD  displays,
              since these have a high reaction time.

       ----tteemmppoorraall--ddiitthheerr--ppeerriioodd==<<11--112288>>
              Determines  how often the dithering pattern is updated when ----tteemmppoorraall--ddiitthheerr is in use.
              1 (the default) will update on every video frame, 2 on every other frame, etc.

       ----ggppuu--ddeebbuugg
              Enables GPU debugging. What this means depends on the API type.  For  OpenGL,  it  calls
              ggllGGeettEErrrroorr(()), and requests a debug context. For Vulkan, it enables validation layers.

       ----ooppeennggll--sswwaappiinntteerrvvaall==<<nn>>
              Interval  in displayed frames between two buffer swaps. 1 is equivalent to enable VSYNC,
              0 to disable VSYNC. Defaults to 1 if not specified.

              Note that this depends on proper OpenGL vsync support. On some  platforms  and  drivers,
              this  only  works  reliably when in fullscreen mode. It may also require driver-specific
              hacks if using multiple monitors, to ensure mpv syncs to the right one. Compositing win‐
              dow  managers  can  also  lead  to  bad results, as can missing or incorrect display FPS
              information (see ----ddiissppllaayy--ffppss).

       ----vvuullkkaann--sswwaapp--mmooddee==<<mmooddee>>
              Controls the presentation  mode  of  the  vulkan  swapchain.  This  is  similar  to  the
              ----ooppeennggll--sswwaappiinntteerrvvaall option.

              aauuttoo   Use the preferred swapchain mode for the vulkan context. (Default)

              ffiiffoo   Non-tearing, vsync blocked. Similar to "VSync on".

              ffiiffoo--rreellaaxxeedd
                     Tearing, vsync blocked. Late frames will tear instead of stuttering.

              mmaaiillbbooxx
                     Non-tearing, not vsync blocked. Similar to "triple buffering".

              iimmmmeeddiiaattee
                     Tearing, not vsync blocked. Similar to "VSync off".

       ----vvuullkkaann--qquueeuuee--ccoouunntt==<<11....88>>
              Controls the number of VkQueues used for rendering (limited by how many your device sup‐
              ports). In theory, using more queues could enable some parallelism between frames  (when
              using  a  ----sswwaappcchhaaiinn--ddeepptthh higher than 1), but it can also slow things down on hardware
              where there's no true parallelism between queues. (Default: 1)

       ----vvuullkkaann--aassyynncc--ttrraannssffeerr
              Enables the use of async transfer queues on supported vulkan devices. Using them  allows
              transfer  operations  like  texture  uploads  and  blits to happen concurrently with the
              actual rendering, thus improving overall throughput and power  consumption.  Enabled  by
              default, and should be relatively safe.

       ----vvuullkkaann--aassyynncc--ccoommppuuttee
              Enables the use of async compute queues on supported vulkan devices. Using this, in the‐
              ory, allows out-of-order scheduling of  compute  shaders  with  graphics  shaders,  thus
              enabling  the  hardware to do more effective work while waiting for pipeline bubbles and
              memory operations. Not beneficial on all GPUs. It's worth noting that if  async  compute
              is  enabled,  and the device supports more compute queues than graphics queues (bound by
              the restrictions set by ----vvuullkkaann--qquueeuuee--ccoouunntt), mpv will internally try  and  prefer  the
              use  of compute shaders over fragment shaders wherever possible. Not enabled by default,
              since it seems to cause issues with some drivers.

       ----dd33dd1111--wwaarrpp==<<yyeess||nnoo||aauuttoo>>
              Use WARP (Windows Advanced Rasterization Platform) with the D3D11 GPU backend  (default:
              auto).  This  is  a high performance software renderer. By default, it is only used when
              the system has no hardware adapters that support D3D11. While the extended GPU  features
              will work with WARP, they can be very slow.

       ----dd33dd1111--ffeeaattuurree--lleevveell==<<1122__11||1122__00||1111__11||1111__00||1100__11||1100__00||99__33||99__22||99__11>>
              Select  a specific feature level when using the D3D11 GPU backend. By default, the high‐
              est available feature level is used. This option can be used to select a  lower  feature
              level,  which  is mainly useful for debugging.  Most extended GPU features will not work
              at 9_x feature levels.

       ----dd33dd1111--fflliipp==<<yyeess||nnoo>>
              Enable flip-model presentation, which avoids unnecessarily  copying  the  backbuffer  by
              sharing  surfaces  with  the  DWM (default: yes). This may cause performance issues with
              older drivers. If flip-model presentation is not supported (for example,  on  Windows  7
              without  the platform update), mpv will automatically fall back to the older bitblt pre‐
              sentation model.

       ----dd33dd1111--ssyynncc--iinntteerrvvaall==<<00....44>>
              Schedule each frame to be presented for this number of VBlank intervals.   (default:  1)
              Setting to 1 will enable VSync, setting to 0 will disable it.

       ----dd33dd1111vvaa--zzeerroo--ccooppyy==<<yyeess||nnoo>>
              By  default,  when using hardware decoding with ----ggppuu--aappii==dd33dd1111, the video image will be
              copied (GPU-to-GPU) from the decoder surface to a shader resource. Set  this  option  to
              avoid  that  copy by sampling directly from the decoder image. This may increase perfor‐
              mance and reduce power usage, but can cause the image to be sampled incorrectly  on  the
              bottom  and  right  edges  due to padding, and may invoke driver bugs, since Direct3D 11
              technically does not allow sampling from a decoder surface (though most drivers  support
              it.)

              Currently only relevant for ----ggppuu--aappii==dd33dd1111.

       ----ssppiirrvv--ccoommppiilleerr==<<ccoommppiilleerr>>
              Controls  which  compiler  is used to translate GLSL to SPIR-V. This is (currently) only
              relevant for ----ggppuu--aappii==vvuullkkaann. The possible choices are:

              aauuttoo   Use the first available compiler. (Default)

              sshhaaddeerrcc
                     Use libshaderc, which is an API wrapper around glslang.  This  is  generally  the
                     most preferred, if available.

              nnvviiddiiaa Use  nvidia's  built-in  compiler.  Only works for nvidia GPUs. Can be buggy, but
                     also supports some features glslang does not. Only works with vulkan.

              Custom GLSL hooks. These are a flexible way to add custom fragment shaders, which can be
              injected  at  almost arbitrary points in the rendering pipeline, and access all previous
              intermediate textures. Each use of the option will add another file to the internal list
              of shaders (see _L_i_s_t _O_p_t_i_o_n_s).

                 Warning

                        The syntax is not stable yet and may change any time.

              The general syntax of a user shader looks like this:

                 //!METADATA ARGS...
                 //!METADATA ARGS...

                 vec4 hook() {
                    ...
                    return something;
                 }

                 //!METADATA ARGS...
                 //!METADATA ARGS...

                 ...

              Each  section  of metadata, along with the non-metadata lines after it, defines a single
              block. There are currently two types of blocks, HOOKs and TEXTUREs.

              A TTEEXXTTUURREE block can set the following options:

              TTEEXXTTUURREE <<nnaammee>> ((rreeqquuiirreedd))
                     The name of this texture. Hooks can then bind the texture under this  name  using
                     BIND. This must be the first option of the texture block.

              SSIIZZEE <<wwiiddtthh>> [[<<hheeiigghhtt>>]] [[<<ddeepptthh>>]] ((rreeqquuiirreedd))
                     The  dimensions  of  the  texture. The height and depth are optional. The type of
                     texture (1D, 2D or 3D) depends on the number of components specified.

              FFOORRMMAATT <<nnaammee>> ((rreeqquuiirreedd))
                     The texture format for the samples. Supported texture formats are listed in debug
                     logging when the ggppuu VO is initialized (look for TTeexxttuurree ffoorrmmaattss::). Usually, this
                     follows OpenGL naming conventions.  For example, rrggbb1166 provides 3  channels  with
                     normalized  16 bit components. One oddity are float formats: for example, rrggbbaa1166ff
                     has 16 bit internal precision, but the texture data is provided as 32 bit floats,
                     and the driver converts the data on texture upload.

                     Although  format  names  follow  a  common naming convention, not all of them are
                     available on all hardware, drivers, GL versions, and so on.

              FFIILLTTEERR <<LLIINNEEAARR||NNEEAARREESSTT>>
                     The min/magnification filter used when sampling from this texture.

              BBOORRDDEERR <<CCLLAAMMPP||RREEPPEEAATT||MMIIRRRROORR>>
                     The border wrapping mode used when sampling from this texture.

              Following the metadata is a string of bytes in hexadecimal notation that define the  raw
              texture  data, corresponding to the format specified by _F_O_R_M_A_T, on a single line with no
              extra whitespace.

              A HHOOOOKK block can set the following options:

              HHOOOOKK <<nnaammee>> ((rreeqquuiirreedd))
                     The texture which to hook into. May occur multiple times within a metadata block,
                     up to a predetermined limit. See below for a list of hookable textures.

              DDEESSCC <<ttiittllee>>
                     User-friendly  description  of  the pass. This is the name used when representing
                     this shader in the list of passes for property _v_o_-_p_a_s_s_e_s.

              BBIINNDD <<nnaammee>>
                     Loads a texture (either coming from mpv or from a TTEEXXTTUURREE  block)  and  makes  it
                     available  to  the  pass.  When  binding textures from mpv, this will also set up
                     macros to facilitate accessing it properly. See below for a list. By default,  no
                     textures  are  bound. The special name HOOKED can be used to refer to the texture
                     that triggered this pass.

              SSAAVVEE <<nnaammee>>
                     Gives the name of the texture to save the result of this pass into.  By  default,
                     this  is  set  to the special name HOOKED which has the effect of overwriting the
                     hooked texture.

              WWIIDDTTHH <<sszzeexxpprr>>,, HHEEIIGGHHTT <<sszzeexxpprr>>
                     Specifies the size of the resulting texture for this pass. sszzeexxpprr  refers  to  an
                     expression  in  RPN (reverse polish notation), using the operators + - * / > < !,
                     floating point literals, and references to sizes of  existing  texture  (such  as
                     MAIN.width or CHROMA.height), OUTPUT, or NATIVE_CROPPED (size of an input texture
                     cropped after pan-and-scan, video-align-x/y,  video-pan-x/y,  etc.  and  possibly
                     prescaled). By default, these are set to HOOKED.w and HOOKED.h, espectively.

              WWHHEENN <<sszzeexxpprr>>
                     Specifies a condition that needs to be true (non-zero) for the shader stage to be
                     evaluated. If it fails, it will silently be omitted. (Note that  a  shader  stage
                     like  this  which has a dependency on an optional hook point can still cause that
                     hook point to be saved, which has some minor overhead)

              OOFFFFSSEETT <<ooxx>> <<ooyy>>
                     Indicates a pixel shift (offset) introduced by this  pass.  These  pixel  offsets
                     will be accumulated and corrected during the next scaling pass (ccssccaallee or ssccaallee).
                     The default values are 0 0 which correspond to no shift. Note  that  offsets  are
                     ignored when not overwriting the hooked texture.

              CCOOMMPPOONNEENNTTSS <<nn>>
                     Specifies  how  many  components of this pass's output are relevant and should be
                     stored in the texture, up to 4 (rgba). By default, this value  is  equal  to  the
                     number of components in HOOKED.

              CCOOMMPPUUTTEE <<bbww>> <<bbhh>> [[<<ttww>> <<tthh>>]]
                     Specifies  that this shader should be treated as a compute shader, with the block
                     size bw and bh. The compute shader will be dispatched with  however  many  blocks
                     are  necessary to completely tile over the output.  Within each block, there will
                     bw tw*th threads, forming a single work group. In other words: tw and th  specify
                     the  work group size, which can be different from the block size. So for example,
                     a compute shader with bw, bh = 32 and tw, th = 8 running  on  a  500x500  texture
                     would dispatch 16x16 blocks (rounded up), each with 8x8 threads.

                     Compute shaders in mpv are treated a bit different from fragment shaders. Instead
                     of defining a vveecc44 hhooookk that produces an output sample, you directly define  vvooiidd
                     hhooookk  which writes to a fixed writeonly image unit named oouutt__iimmaaggee (this is bound
                     by mpv) using _i_m_a_g_e_S_t_o_r_e. To help translate texture coordinates in the absence of
                     vertices,  mpv  provides  a  special  function NNAAMMEE__mmaapp((iidd)) to map from the texel
                     space of the output image to the texture coordinates for all bound  textures.  In
                     particular,  NNAAMMEE__ppooss  is equivalent to NNAAMMEE__mmaapp((ggll__GGlloobbaallIInnvvooccaattiioonnIIDD)), although
                     using this only really makes sense if (tw,th) == (bw,bh).

              Each bound mpv texture (via BBIINNDD) will make available the following definitions to  that
              shader pass, where NAME is the name of the bound texture:

              vveecc44 NNAAMMEE__tteexx((vveecc22 ppooss))
                     The  sampling function to use to access the texture at a certain spot (in texture
                     coordinate space, range [0,1]). This takes care of  any  necessary  normalization
                     conversions.

              vveecc44 NNAAMMEE__tteexxOOffff((vveecc22 ooffffsseett))
                     Sample  the  texture  at a certain offset in pixels. This works like NAME_tex but
                     additionally takes  care  of  necessary  rotations,  so  that  sampling  at  e.g.
                     vec2(-1,0) is always one pixel to the left.

              vveecc22 NNAAMMEE__ppooss
                     The local texture coordinate of that texture, range [0,1].

              vveecc22 NNAAMMEE__ssiizzee
                     The (rotated) size in pixels of the texture.

              mmaatt22 NNAAMMEE__rroott
                     The rotation matrix associated with this texture. (Rotates pixel space to texture
                     coordinates)

              vveecc22 NNAAMMEE__pptt
                     The (unrotated) size of a single pixel, range [0,1].

              ffllooaatt NNAAMMEE__mmuull
                     The coefficient that needs to be multiplied into the texture contents in order to
                     normalize it to the range [0,1].

              ssaammpplleerr NNAAMMEE__rraaww
                     The raw bound texture itself. The use of this should be avoided unless absolutely
                     necessary.

              Normally, users should use either NAME_tex or NAME_texOff to read from the texture.  For
              some  shaders  however  ,  it  can  be better for performance to do custom sampling from
              NAME_raw, in which case care needs to be taken to respect NAME_mul and NAME_rot.

              In addition to these parameters, the following uniforms are also globally available:

              ffllooaatt rraannddoomm
                     A random number in the range [0-1], different per frame.

              iinntt ffrraammee
                     A simple count of frames rendered, increases by one per frame  and  never  resets
                     (regardless of seeks).

              vveecc22 iinnppuutt__ssiizzee
                     The size in pixels of the input image (possibly cropped and prescaled).

              vveecc22 ttaarrggeett__ssiizzee
                     The  size  in  pixels  of  the  visible part of the scaled (and possibly cropped)
                     image.

              vveecc22 tteexx__ooffffsseett
                     Texture  offset  introduced  by   user   shaders   or   options   like   panscan,
                     video-align-x/y, video-pan-x/y.

              Internally,  vo_gpu  may generate any number of the following textures.  Whenever a tex‐
              ture is rendered and saved by vo_gpu, all of the passes that have hooked  into  it  will
              run, in the order they were added by the user. This is a list of the legal hook points:

              RRGGBB,, LLUUMMAA,, CCHHRROOMMAA,, AALLPPHHAA,, XXYYZZ ((rreessiizzaabbllee))
                     Source  planes  (raw).  Which  of  these  fire depends on the image format of the
                     source.

              CCHHRROOMMAA__SSCCAALLEEDD,, AALLPPHHAA__SSCCAALLEEDD ((ffiixxeedd))
                     Source planes (upscaled). These only fire on subsampled content.

              NNAATTIIVVEE ((rreessiizzaabbllee))
                     The combined image, in the source colorspace, before conversion to RGB.

              MMAAIINNPPRREESSUUBB ((rreessiizzaabbllee))
                     The image,  after  conversion  to  RGB,  but  before  ----bblleenndd--ssuubbttiittlleess==vviiddeeoo  is
                     applied.

              MMAAIINN ((rreessiizzaabbllee))
                     The main image, after conversion to RGB but before upscaling.

              LLIINNEEAARR ((ffiixxeedd))
                     Linear  light  image, before scaling. This only fires when ----lliinneeaarr--ssccaalliinngg is in
                     effect.

              SSIIGGMMOOIIDD ((ffiixxeedd))
                     Sigmoidized light, before scaling. This only fires when ----ssiiggmmooiidd--uuppssccaalliinngg is in
                     effect.

              PPRREEKKEERRNNEELL ((ffiixxeedd))
                     The image immediately before the scaler kernel runs.

              PPOOSSTTKKEERRNNEELL ((ffiixxeedd))
                     The image immediately after the scaler kernel runs.

              SSCCAALLEEDD ((ffiixxeedd))
                     The final upscaled image, before color management.

              OOUUTTPPUUTT ((ffiixxeedd))
                     The  final  output image, after color management but before dithering and drawing
                     to screen.

              Only the textures labelled with rreessiizzaabbllee may be transformed by the pass. When overwrit‐
              ing  a  texture marked ffiixxeedd, the WIDTH, HEIGHT and OFFSET must be left at their default
              values.

       ----ggllssll--sshhaaddeerr==<<ffiillee>>
              CLI/config file only alias for ----ggllssll--sshhaaddeerrss--aappppeenndd.

       ----ddeebbaanndd
              Enable the debanding algorithm. This greatly reduces  the  amount  of  visible  banding,
              blocking and other quantization artifacts, at the expense of very slightly blurring some
              of the finest details. In practice, it's virtually always an improvement - the only rea‐
              son to disable it would be for performance.

       ----ddeebbaanndd--iitteerraattiioonnss==<<11....1166>>
              The  number of debanding steps to perform per sample. Each step reduces a bit more band‐
              ing, but takes time to compute. Note that the strength  of  each  step  falls  off  very
              quickly, so high numbers (>4) are practically useless.  (Default 1)

       ----ddeebbaanndd--tthhrreesshhoolldd==<<00....44009966>>
              The debanding filter's cut-off threshold. Higher numbers increase the debanding strength
              dramatically but progressively diminish image details.  (Default 64)

       ----ddeebbaanndd--rraannggee==<<11....6644>>
              The debanding filter's initial radius. The radius increases linearly for each iteration.
              A  higher  radius  will find more gradients, but a lower radius will smooth more aggres‐
              sively. (Default 16)

              If you increase the ----ddeebbaanndd--iitteerraattiioonnss, you should probably decrease  this  to  compen‐
              sate.

       ----ddeebbaanndd--ggrraaiinn==<<00....44009966>>
              Add some extra noise to the image. This significantly helps cover up remaining quantiza‐
              tion artifacts. Higher numbers add more noise. (Default 48)

       ----ssiiggmmooiidd--uuppssccaalliinngg
              When upscaling, use a sigmoidal color transform to avoid emphasizing ringing  artifacts.
              This also implies ----lliinneeaarr--ssccaalliinngg.

       ----ssiiggmmooiidd--cceenntteerr
              The  center  of  the sigmoid curve used for ----ssiiggmmooiidd--uuppssccaalliinngg, must be a float between
              0.0 and 1.0. Defaults to 0.75 if not specified.

       ----ssiiggmmooiidd--ssllooppee
              The slope of the sigmoid curve used for ----ssiiggmmooiidd--uuppssccaalliinngg, must be a float between 1.0
              and 20.0. Defaults to 6.5 if not specified.

       ----sshhaarrppeenn==<<vvaalluuee>>
              If  set  to a value other than 0, enable an unsharp masking filter. Positive values will
              sharpen the image (but add more ringing and aliasing). Negative  values  will  blur  the
              image.  If  your GPU is powerful enough, consider alternatives like the eewwaa__llaanncczzoosssshhaarrpp
              scale filter, or the ----ssccaallee--bblluurr option.

       ----ooppeennggll--ggllffiinniisshh
              Call ggllFFiinniisshh(()) before swapping buffers (default: disabled). Slower, but  might  improve
              results  when  doing  framedropping. Can completely ruin performance. The details depend
              entirely on the OpenGL driver.

       ----ooppeennggll--wwaaiittvvssyynncc
              Call ggllXXWWaaiittVViiddeeooSSyynnccSSGGII after each buffer swap (default: disabled).  This  may  or  may
              not  help with video timing accuracy and frame drop. It's possible that this makes video
              output slower, or has no effect at all.

              X11/GLX only.

       ----ooppeennggll--ddwwmmfflluusshh==<<nnoo||wwiinnddoowweedd||yyeess||aauuttoo>>
              Calls DDwwmmFFlluusshh after swapping buffers on Windows (default: auto). It also  sets  SSwwaappIInn‐‐
              tteerrvvaall((00)) to ignore the OpenGL timing. Values are: no (disabled), windowed (only in win‐
              dowed mode), yes (also in full screen).

              The value aauuttoo will try to determine whether the compositor is active,  and  calls  DDwwmm‐‐
              FFlluusshh only if it seems to be.

              This  may  help to get more consistent frame intervals, especially with high-fps clips -
              which might also reduce dropped frames. Typically, a value of wwiinnddoowweedd should be enough,
              since full screen may bypass the DWM.

              Selects  a  specific feature level when using the ANGLE backend with D3D11.  By default,
              the highest available feature level is used. This option can be used to select  a  lower
              feature  level,  which  is mainly useful for debugging.  Note that OpenGL ES 3.0 is only
              supported at feature level 10_1 or higher.  Most extended OpenGL features will not  work
              at lower feature levels (similar to ----ggppuu--dduummbb--mmooddee).

              Use  WARP  (Windows  Advanced  Rasterization Platform) when using the ANGLE backend with
              D3D11 (default: auto). This is a high performance software renderer. By default,  it  is
              used  when  the  Direct3D hardware does not support Direct3D 11 feature level 9_3. While
              the extended OpenGL features will work with WARP, they can be very slow.

              Use ANGLE's built in EGL windowing functions to create a swap chain (default: auto).  If
              this is set to nnoo and the D3D11 renderer is in use, ANGLE's built in swap chain will not
              be used and a custom swap chain that is optimized for video rendering  will  be  created
              instead.  If  set  to  aauuttoo, a custom swap chain will be used for D3D11 and the built in
              swap chain will be used for D3D9. This option is mainly for debugging purposes, in  case
              the custom swap chain has poor performance or does not work.

       ----aannggllee--fflliipp==<<yyeess||nnoo>>
              Enable flip-model presentation, which avoids unnecessarily  copying  the  backbuffer  by
              sharing  surfaces  with  the  DWM (default: yes). This may cause performance issues with
              older drivers. If flip-model presentation is not supported (for example,  on  Windows  7
              without  the platform update), mpv will automatically fall back to the older bitblt pre‐
              sentation model.

              Forces a specific renderer when using the ANGLE backend (default: auto).  In  auto  mode
              this  will  pick D3D11 for systems that support Direct3D 11 feature level 9_3 or higher,
              and D3D9 otherwise. This option is mainly for debugging purposes. Normally there  is  no
              reason to force a specific renderer, though ----aannggllee--rreennddeerreerr==dd33dd99 may give slightly bet‐
              ter performance on old hardware. Note that the D3D9 renderer  only  supports  OpenGL  ES
              2.0,  so most extended OpenGL features will not work if this renderer is selected (simi‐

              Use  the  Apple  Software Renderer when using cocoa-cb (default: auto). If set to nnoo the
              software renderer is never used and instead fails when a the usual  pixel  format  could
              not be created, yyeess will always only use the software renderer, and aauuttoo only falls back

              Sets the fullscreen resize animation duration in ms  (default:  default).   The  default
              value  is  slightly  less  than  the system's animation duration (500ms) to prevent some
              problems when the end of an async animation happens at the same time as the end  of  the
              system  wide  fullscreen  animation. Setting anything higher than 500ms will only prema‐
              turely cancel the resize animation after the system  wide  animation  ended.  The  upper
              limit is still set at 1000ms since it's possible that Apple or the user changes the sys‐
              tem defaults. Anything higher than 1000ms though seems too long  and  shouldn't  be  set

              Allow  up to N in-flight frames. This essentially controls the frame latency. Increasing
              the swapchain depth can improve pipelining and prevent missed vsyncs, but increases vis‐
              ible  latency.  This  option  only mandates an upper limit, the implementation can use a
              lower latency than requested internally. A setting of 1 means that the VO will wait  for
              every frame to become visible before starting to render the next frame. (Default: 3)

              Restricts all OpenGL versions above a certain version. Versions are encoded in hundreds,
              i.e. OpenGL 4.5 -> 450. As an example, --opengl-restrict=300 would restrict  OpenGL  3.0
              and  higher, effectively only allowing 2.x contexts. Note that this only imposes a limit
              on context creation APIs, the actual OpenGL context may still have a higher OpenGL  ver‐
              sion. (Default: 0)

              rgb16f, rgb32f, rgba12, rgba16, rgba16f, rgba16hf, rgba32f.

              Default:  aauuttoo,  which  first  attempts  to utilize 16bit float (rgba16f, rgba16hf), and
              falls back to rgba16 if those are not available.  Finally, attempts to utilize  rgb10_a2

              Set  an  additional  raw gamma factor (default: 1.0). If gamma is adjusted in other ways
              (like with the ----ggaammmmaa option or key bindings and the ggaammmmaa property), the value is mul‐
              tiplied with the other gamma value.

              Recommended values based on the environmental brightness:

              11..00    Pitch black or dimly lit room (default)

              11..11    Moderately lit room, home

              11..22    Brightly illuminated room, office

              NOTE:  This  is based around the assumptions of typical movie content, which contains an
              implicit end-to-end of about 0.8 from scene to display. For bright environments  it  can
              be useful to cancel that out.

              Automatically  corrects the gamma value depending on ambient lighting conditions (adding
              a gamma boost for bright rooms).

              With ambient illuminance of 16 lux, mpv will pick the 1.0 gamma value  (no  boost),  and
              slightly increase the boost up until 1.2 for 256 lux.

              NNOOTTEE::
                 When using HDR output formats, mpv will encode to the specified curve but it will not
                 set any HDMI flags or other signalling that might be required for the  target  device
                 to  correctly  display  the HDR signal.  The user should independently guarantee this
                 before using these signal formats for display.

       ----ttaarrggeett--ppeeaakk==<<nniittss>>
              Specifies the measured peak brightness of the output display, in cd/m^2 (AKA nits).  The
              interpretation  of this brightness depends on the configured ----ttaarrggeett--ttrrcc. In all cases,
              it imposes a limit on the signal values that will be sent to the display. If the  source
              exceeds  this  brightness level, a tone mapping filter will be inserted. For HLG, it has
              the additional effect of parametrizing the inverse OOTF, in order  to  get  colorimetri‐
              cally consistent results with the mastering display. For SDR, or when using an ICC (pro‐
              file (----iicccc--pprrooffiillee), setting this to a value above 100 essentially causes  the  display
              to be treated as if it were an HDR display in disguise. (See the note below)

              By  default,  the  chosen peak defaults to an appropriate value based on the TRC in use.
              For SDR curves, it defaults to 100. For HDR curves, it defaults to 100  *  the  transfer
              function's nominal peak.

              NNOOTTEE::
                 When  using an SDR transfer function, this is normally not needed, and setting it may
                 lead to very unexpected results. The one time it _i_s useful is if you  want  to  cali‐
                 brate  a  HDR display using traditional transfer functions and calibration equipment.
                 In such cases, you can set your HDR display to a high brightness such as 800  cd/m^2,
                 and  then  calibrate  it to a standard curve like gamma2.8. Setting this value to 800
                 would then instruct mpv to essentially treat it as an  HDR  display  with  the  given
                 peak.  This  may  be  a good alternative in environments where PQ or HLG input to the
                 display is not possible, and makes it possible to use HDR displays with  mpv  regard‐
                 less of operating system support for HDMI HDR metadata.

                 In such a configuration, we highly recommend setting ----ttoonnee--mmaappppiinngg to mmoobbiiuuss or even
                 cclliipp.

              Specifies the algorithm used for tone-mapping images onto the target  display.  This  is
              relevant  for  both  HDR->SDR  conversion  as well as gamut reduction (e.g. playing back
              BT.2020 content on a standard gamut display).  Valid values are:

              cclliipp   Hard-clip any out-of-range values. Use this when you  care  about  perfect  color
                     accuracy  for  in-range  values at the cost of completely distorting out-of-range
                     values. Not generally recommended.

              mmoobbiiuuss Generalization of Reinhard to a Möbius transform with linear  section.   Smoothly
                     maps  out-of-range  values while retaining contrast and colors for in-range mate‐
                     rial as much as possible. Use this when you care about color accuracy  more  than
                     detail preservation. This is somewhere in between cclliipp and rreeiinnhhaarrdd, depending on
                     the value of ----ttoonnee--mmaappppiinngg--ppaarraamm.

              rreeiinnhhaarrdd
                     Reinhard tone mapping algorithm. Very simple continuous curve.  Preserves overall
                     image  brightness  but  uses  nonlinear  contrast, which results in flattening of
                     details and degradation in color accuracy.

              hhaabbllee  Similar to rreeiinnhhaarrdd but preserves both dark and bright details  better  (slightly
                     sigmoidal),  at  the cost of slightly darkening / desaturating everything. Devel‐
                     oped by John Hable for use in video games. Use this when you  care  about  detail
                     preservation  more  than color/brightness accuracy. This is roughly equivalent to

              ggaammmmaa  Fits a logarithmic transfer between the tone curves.

              lliinneeaarr Linearly  stretches the entire reference gamut to (a linear multiple of) the dis‐

              Set tone mapping parameters. Ignored if the tone mapping algorithm is not tunable.  This
              affects the following tone mapping algorithms:

              cclliipp   Specifies  an  extra  linear coefficient to multiply into the signal before clip‐
                     ping. Defaults to 1.0.

              mmoobbiiuuss Specifies the transition point from linear to mobius transform. Every value below
                     this  point  is guaranteed to be mapped 1:1. The higher the value, the more accu‐
                     rate the result will be, at the cost of losing bright details. Defaults  to  0.3,
                     which due to the steep initial slope still preserves in-range colors fairly accu‐
                     rately.

              rreeiinnhhaarrdd
                     Specifies the local contrast coefficient at the display peak.  Defaults  to  0.5,
                     which means that in-gamut values will be about half as bright as when clipping.

              ggaammmmaa  Specifies the exponent of the function. Defaults to 1.8.

              lliinneeaarr Specifies the scale factor to use while stretching. Defaults to 1.0.

       ----hhddrr--ccoommppuuttee--ppeeaakk==<<aauuttoo||yyeess||nnoo>>
              Compute the HDR peak and frame average brightness per-frame instead of relying on tagged
              metadata. These values are averaged over local regions as well as over several frames to
              prevent  the  value  from  jittering  around  too  much. This option basically gives you
              dynamic, per-scene tone mapping.  Requires compute shaders, which  is  a  fairly  recent
              OpenGL  feature,  and  will probably also perform horribly on some drivers, so enable at
              your own risk.  The special value aauuttoo (default) will enable HDR peak computation  auto‐
              matically if compute shaders and SSBOs are supported.

       ----ttoonnee--mmaappppiinngg--ddeessaattuurraattee==<<vvaalluuee>>
              Apply  desaturation  for highlights. The parameter essentially controls the steepness of
              the desaturation curve. The higher the parameter, the more aggressively colors  will  be
              desaturated.  This  setting  helps  prevent unnaturally blown-out colors for super-high‐
              lights, by (smoothly) turning into white instead. This makes images feel  more  natural,
              at the cost of reducing information about out-of-range colors.

              The  default  of  0.5  provides  a  good balance. This value is weaker than the ACES ODT
              curves' recommendation, but works better for most content in practice. A setting of  0.0
              disables this option.

       ----ggaammuutt--wwaarrnniinngg
              If  enabled, mpv will mark all clipped/out-of-gamut pixels that exceed a given threshold
              (currently hard-coded to 101%). The affected pixels will be inverted to make them  stand
              out. Note: This option applies after the effects of all of mpv's color space transforma‐
              tion / tone mapping options, so it's a  good  idea  to  combine  this  with  ----ttoonnee--mmaapp‐‐
              ppiinngg==cclliipp  and  use  ----ttaarrggeett--pprriimm  to  set  the  gamut to simulate. For example, ----ttaarr‐‐
              ggeett--pprriimm==bbtt..770099 would make mpv highlight all pixels that exceed the gamut of a  standard
              gamut  (sRGB)  display. This option also does not work well with ICC profiles, since the
              3DLUTs are always generated against the source color space and have  chromatically-accu‐
              rate clipping built in.

       ----uussee--eemmbbeeddddeedd--iicccc--pprrooffiillee
              Load  the  embedded  ICC profile contained in media files such as PNG images.  (Default:
              yes). Note that this option only works when also using a display ICC profile (----iicccc--pprroo‐‐
              ffiillee or ----iicccc--pprrooffiillee--aauuttoo), and also requires LittleCMS 2 support.

       ----iicccc--pprrooffiillee==<<ffiillee>>
              Load an ICC profile and use it to transform video RGB to screen output.  Needs LittleCMS
              2 support compiled  in.  This  option  overrides  the  ----ttaarrggeett--pprriimm,  ----ttaarrggeett--ttrrcc  and
              ----iicccc--pprrooffiillee--aauuttoo options.

       ----iicccc--pprrooffiillee--aauuttoo
              Automatically select the ICC display profile currently specified by the display settings
              of the operating system.

              NOTE: On Windows, the default profile must be an ICC profile. WCS profiles are not  sup‐
              ported.

              Applications  using  libmpv  with  the  render  API  need to provide the ICC profile via
              MMPPVV__RREENNDDEERR__PPAARRAAMM__IICCCC__PPRROOFFIILLEE.

              Store and load the 3D LUTs created from the ICC profile in this directory.  This can  be
              used  to  speed  up loading, since LittleCMS 2 can take a while to create a 3D LUT. Note
              that these files contain uncompressed LUTs. Their size depends on the  ----iicccc--33ddlluutt--ssiizzee,
              and can be very big.

              NOTE:  This  is  not  cleaned automatically, so old, unused cache files may stick around
              indefinitely.

       ----iicccc--iinntteenntt==<<vvaalluuee>>
              Specifies the ICC intent used for the color transformation (when using ----iicccc--pprrooffiillee).

              00      perceptual

              Size of the 3D LUT generated from  the  ICC  profile  in  each  dimension.   Default  is
              64x64x64. Sizes may range from 2 to 512.

       ----iicccc--ccoonnttrraasstt==<<00--11000000000000>>
              Specifies  an  upper limit on the target device's contrast ratio. This is detected auto‐
              matically from the profile if possible, but for some profiles it might be missing, caus‐
              ing  the  contrast  to be assumed as infinite. As a result, video may appear darker than
              intended. This only affects BT.1886 content. The default of 0 means no limit.

       ----bblleenndd--ssuubbttiittlleess==<<yyeess||vviiddeeoo||nnoo>>
              Blend subtitles directly onto upscaled video frames, before interpolation  and/or  color
              management  (default:  no).  Enabling this causes subtitles to be affected by ----iicccc--pprroo‐‐
              ffiillee, ----ttaarrggeett--pprriimm, ----ttaarrggeett--ttrrcc, ----iinntteerrppoollaattiioonn, ----ggaammmmaa--ffaaccttoorr  and  ----ggllssll--sshhaaddeerrss.
              It also increases subtitle performance when using ----iinntteerrppoollaattiioonn.

              The  downside  of enabling this is that it restricts subtitles to the visible portion of
              the video, so you can't have subtitles exist in the black margins  below  a  video  (for
              example).

              If  vviiddeeoo is selected, the behavior is similar to yyeess, but subs are drawn at the video's
              native resolution, and scaled along with the video.

              WWAARRNNIINNGG::
                 This changes the way subtitle colors  are  handled.  Normally,  subtitle  colors  are
                 assumed  to be in sRGB and color managed as such. Enabling this makes them treated as
                 being in the video's color space instead. This is good if you want things like  soft‐
                 subbed ASS signs to match the video colors, but may cause SRT subtitles or similar to
                 look slightly off.

       ----aallpphhaa==<<bblleenndd--ttiilleess||bblleenndd||yyeess||nnoo>>

                     Blend the frame against a 16x16 gray/white tiles background (default).

              bblleenndd  Blend the frame against the background color (----bbaacckkggrroouunndd, normally black).

              yyeess    Try to create a framebuffer with alpha component. This only makes  sense  if  the
                     video  contains alpha information (which is extremely rare). May not be supported
                     on all platforms. If alpha framebuffers are unavailable, it silently  falls  back
                     on  a  normal  framebuffer.  Note  that  if  you set the ----ffbboo--ffoorrmmaatt option to a
                     non-default value, a format with alpha must be specified,  or  this  won't  work.
                     This does not work on X11 with EGL and Mesa (freedesktop bug 67676).

              nnoo     Ignore alpha component.

              Force  use  of rectangle textures (default: no). Normally this shouldn't have any advan‐
              tages over normal textures. Note that hardware decoding overrides this  flag.  Could  be
              removed any time.

              Enlarge the video source textures by this many pixels. For debugging only (normally tex‐
              tures  are  sized exactly, but due to hardware decoding interop we may have to deal with
              additional padding, which can be tested with these options). Could be removed any time.

              Call ggllFFlluusshh(()) after rendering a frame and before attempting  to  display  it  (default:
              auto).  Can  fix  stuttering  in some cases, in other cases probably causes it. The aauuttoo
              mode will call ggllFFlluusshh(()) only if the renderer is going to wait for a while after render‐
              ing,  instead  of flipping GL front and backbuffers immediately (i.e. it doesn't call it
              in display-sync mode).

              On OSX this is always deactivated because it only causes performance problems and  other
              regressions.

              This  mode  is  extremely  restricted,  and  will  disable  most extended features. That
              includes high quality scalers and custom shaders!

              It is intended for hardware that does not support FBOs (including GLES,  which  supports
              it insufficiently), or to get some more performance out of bad or old hardware.

              This mode is forced automatically if needed, and this option is mostly useful for debug‐
              ging. The default of aauuttoo will enable it automatically if nothing  uses  features  which
              require FBOs.

              This option might be silently removed in the future.

              Store  and load compiled GLSL shaders in this directory. Normally, shader compilation is
              very fast, so this is usually not needed. It mostly matters for GPU  APIs  that  require
              internally  recompiling  shaders to other languages, for example anything based on ANGLE
              or Vulkan. Enabling this can improve startup performance on these platforms.

              NOTE: This is not cleaned automatically, so old, unused cache  files  may  stick  around
              indefinitely.

              ----nnoo--aauuddiioo can often be helped by setting this to an integer value greater than  1.  The
              higher  the  value,  the  closer  the timing will be to ----nnoo--aauuddiioo. Try ----aauuttoossyynncc==3300 to
              smooth out problems with sound drivers which do not implement a perfect audio delay mea‐
              surement.  With this value, if large A/V sync offsets occur, they will only take about 1
              or 2 seconds to settle out. This delay in reaction time to sudden A/V offsets should  be
              the only side effect of turning this option on, for all sound drivers.

       ----vviiddeeoo--ttiimmiinngg--ooffffsseett==<<sseeccoonnddss>>
              Control how long before video display target time the frame should be rendered (default:
              0.050). If a video frame should be displayed at a certain time, the VO will  start  ren‐
              dering  the frame earlier, and then will perform a blocking wait until the display time,
              and only then "swap" the frame to display. The rendering cannot start before the  previ‐
              ous frame is displayed, so this value is implicitly limited by the video framerate. With
              normal video frame rates, the default value will ensure that rendering is always immedi‐
              ately  started  after the previous frame was displayed. On the other hand, setting a too
              high value can reduce responsiveness with low FPS value.

              For client API users using the render API (or the deprecated ooppeennggll--ccbb API), this option
              is interesting, because you can stop the render API from limiting your FPS (see mmppvv__rreenn‐‐
              ddeerr__ccoonntteexxtt__rreennddeerr(()) documentation).

              This applies only to audio  timing  modes  (e.g.  ----vviiddeeoo--ssyynncc==aauuddiioo).  In  other  modes
              (----vviiddeeoo--ssyynncc==ddiissppllaayy--......),  video  timing  relies on vsync blocking, and this option is
              not used.

       ----vviiddeeoo--ssyynncc==<<aauuddiioo||......>>
              How the player synchronizes audio and video.

              If you use this option, you usually want to set it to ddiissppllaayy--rreessaammppllee to enable a  tim‐
              ing mode that tries to not skip or repeat frames when for example playing 24fps video on
              a 24Hz screen.

              The modes starting with ddiissppllaayy-- try to output video frames completely synchronously  to
              the  display, using the detected display vertical refresh rate as a hint how fast frames
              will be displayed on average. These modes change video speed slightly to match the  dis‐
              play. See ----vviiddeeoo--ssyynncc--......  options for fine tuning. The robustness of this mode is fur‐
              ther reduced by making a some idealized assumptions, which may not always apply in real‐
              ity.   Behavior  can  depend  on the VO and the system's video and audio drivers.  Media
              files must use constant framerate. Section-wise VFR might work as well  with  some  con‐
              tainer  formats  (but  not e.g. mkv). If the sync code detects severe A/V desync, or the
              framerate cannot be detected, the player automatically reverts to aauuddiioo  mode  for  some
              time  or  permanently.  These  modes also require a vsync blocked presentation mode. For
              OpenGL, this  translates  to  ----ooppeennggll--sswwaappiinntteerrvvaall==11.  For  Vulkan,  it  translates  to
              ----vvuullkkaann--sswwaapp--mmooddee==ffiiffoo (or ffiiffoo--rreellaaxxeedd).

              The  modes  with  ddeessyynncc in their names do not attempt to keep audio/video in sync. They
              will slowly (or quickly) desync, until e.g. the next seek happens. These modes are meant
              for testing, not serious use.

              aauuddiioo  Time  video  frames  to  audio.  This is the most robust mode, because the player
                     doesn't have to assume anything about how the display behaves.  The  disadvantage
                     is  that  it can lead to occasional frame drops or repeats. If audio is disabled,
                     this uses the system clock. This is the default mode.

              ddiissppllaayy--rreessaammppllee
                     Resample audio to match the video. This mode will also try to adjust audio  speed
                     to compensate for other drift.  (This means it will play the audio at a different
                     speed every once in a while to reduce the A/V difference.)

              ddiissppllaayy--rreessaammppllee--vvddrroopp
                     Resample audio to match the video. Drop video frames to compensate for drift.

                     Like the previous mode, but no A/V compensation.

              ddiissppllaayy--vvddrroopp
                     Drop or repeat video frames to compensate desyncing video.  (Although  it  should
                     have the same effects as aauuddiioo, the implementation is very different.)

              ddiissppllaayy--aaddrroopp
                     Drop    or    repeat    audio   data   to   compensate   desyncing   video.   See
                     ----vviiddeeoo--ssyynncc--aaddrroopp--ssiizzee. This mode will cause severe audio artifacts if the  real
                     monitor refresh rate is too different from the reported or forced rate.

              ddiissppllaayy--ddeessyynncc
                     Sync video to display, and let audio play on its own.

              Maximum  speed  difference  in  percent  that is applied to video with ----vviiddeeoo--ssyynncc==ddiiss‐‐
              ppllaayy--...... (default: 1). Display sync mode will be  disabled  if  the  monitor  and  video
              refresh  way do not match within the given range. It tries multiples as well: playing 30
              fps video on a 60 Hz screen will duplicate every second frame. Playing 24 fps video on a
              60 Hz screen will play video in a 2-3-2-3-... pattern.

              The  default  settings  are  not loose enough to speed up 23.976 fps video to 25 fps. We
              consider the pitch change too extreme to allow this behavior by default. Set this option
              to a value of 55 to enable it.

              Note  that  in  the ----vviiddeeoo--ssyynncc==ddiissppllaayy--rreessaammppllee mode, audio speed will additionally be
              changed by a small amount if necessary for A/V sync. See ----vviiddeeoo--ssyynncc--mmaaxx--aauuddiioo--cchhaannggee.

              Maximum  _a_d_d_i_t_i_o_n_a_l  speed  difference  in  percent  that  is  applied  to  audio   with

              speed of the video. But if the difference between audio and video position is too  high,
              e.g. due to drift or other timing errors, it will attempt to speed up or slow down audio
              by this additional factor. Too low values could lead to video frame dropping or  repeat‐
              ing if the A/V desync cannot be compensated, too high values could lead to chaotic frame
              dropping due to the audio "overshooting" and skipping multiple video frames  before  the
              sync logic can react.

              audio in sync with video. To avoid audio artifacts on  jitter  (which  would  add/remove
              samples all the time), this is done in relatively large, fixed units, controlled by this
              option. The unit is seconds.

       ----mmff--ffppss==<<vvaalluuee>>

              Input file type for mmff:://// (available: jpeg, png, tga, sgi). By default, this is  guessed

              Instead  of  playing  a file, read its byte stream and write it to the given destination

              Set AVOptions on streams opened with libavformat.  Unknown  or  misspelled  options  are
              silently  ignored. (They are mentioned in the terminal output in verbose mode, i.e. ----vv.
              In general we can't print errors, because other options such as e.g. user agent are  not
              available with all protocols, and printing errors for unknown options would end up being
              too noisy.)

              Force the contents of the mmeeddiiaa--ttiittllee property to this value. Useful for  scripts  which
              want to set a title, without overriding the user's setting in ----ttiittllee.

              Load  a  file and add all of its tracks. This is useful to play different files together
              (for example audio from one file, video from another), or for  advanced  ----llaavvffii--ccoommpplleexx
              used (like playing two video files at the same time).

              Unlike  ----ssuubb--ffiilleess  and  ----aauuddiioo--ffiilleess,  this  includes  all tracks, and does not cause
              default stream selection over the "proper" file. This makes it slightly less  intrusive.
              (In mpv 0.28.0 and before, this was not quite strictly enforced.)

              This is a list option. See _L_i_s_t _O_p_t_i_o_n_s for details.

       ----eexxtteerrnnaall--ffiillee==<<ffiillee>>

              a new external files.

       ----aauuttoollooaadd--ffiilleess==<<yyeess||nnoo>>
              Automatically load/select external files (default: yes).

              If set to nnoo, then do not automatically load external files as specified  by  ----ssuubb--aauuttoo
              and  ----aauuddiioo--ffiillee--aauuttoo.  If  external  files are forcibly added (like with ----ssuubb--ffiilleess),
              they will not be auto-selected.

              This does not affect playlist expansion, redirection, or  other  loading  of  referenced
              files like with ordered chapters.

       ----rreeccoorrdd--ffiillee==<<ffiillee>>
              Record the current stream to the given target file. The target file will always be over‐
              written without asking.

              This remuxes the source stream without reencoding, which makes this a highly fragile and
              experimental  feature.  It's  entirely possible that this writes files which are broken,
              not standards compliant, not playable with all players (including mpv), or incomplete.

              The target file format is determined by the file extension of the target filename. It is
              recommended  to  use  the same target container as the source container if possible, and
              preferring Matroska as fallback.

              Seeking during stream recording, or enabling/disabling stream recording during playback,
              can  cut  off data, or produce "holes" in the output file.  These are technical restric‐
              tions. In particular, video data or subtitles which were read  ahead  can  produce  such
              holes, which might cause playback problems with various players (including mpv).

              The  behavior  of this option might changed in the future, such as changing it to a tem‐
              plate (similar to ----ssccrreeeennsshhoott--tteemmppllaattee), being  renamed,  removed,  or  anything  else,
              until it is declared semi-stable.

       ----llaavvffii--ccoommpplleexx==<<ssttrriinngg>>
              Set  a  "complex"  libavfilter  filter, which means a single filter graph can take input
              from multiple source audio and video tracks. The graph can result in a single  audio  or
              video output (or both).

              Currently, the filter graph labels are used to select the participating input tracks and
              audio/video output. The following rules apply:

              · A label of the form aaiiddNN selects audio track N as input (e.g.  aaiidd11).

              · A label of the form vviiddNN selects video track N as input.

              · A label named aaoo will be connected to the audio output.

              · A label named vvoo will be connected to the video output.

              Each label can be used only once. If you want to use e.g. an audio stream  for  multiple
              filters, you need to use the aasspplliitt filter. Multiple video or audio outputs are not pos‐
              sible, but you can use filters to merge them into one.

              It's not possible to change the tracks connected to the filter at  runtime,  unless  you
              explicitly  change  the  llaavvffii--ccoommpplleexx  property and set new track assignments. When the
              graph is changed, the track selection is changed according to the used labels as well.

              Other tracks, as long as they're not connected to the filter, and the corresponding out‐
              put is not connected to the filter, can still be freely changed with the normal methods.

              Note  that  the normal filter chains (----aaff, ----vvff) are applied between the complex graphs
              (e.g. aaoo label) and the actual output.

AAUUDDIIOO OOUUTTPPUUTT DDRRIIVVEERRSS
       Audio output drivers are interfaces to different audio output facilities. The syntax is:

       ----aaoo==<<ddrriivveerr11,,ddrriivveerr22,,......[[,,]]>>
              Specify a priority list of audio output drivers to be used.

       If the list has a trailing ',', mpv will fall back on drivers not contained in the list.

       NNOOTTEE::
          See ----aaoo==hheellpp for a list of compiled-in audio output drivers. The driver ----aaoo==aallssaa  is  pre‐
          ferred.  ----aaoo==ppuullssee  is  preferred  on  systems  where  PulseAudio  is used. On BSD systems,
          ----aaoo==oossss or ----aaoo==ssnnddiioo may work (the latter being experimental).

       Available audio output drivers are:

       aallssaa ((LLiinnuuxx oonnllyy))
              ALSA audio output driver

              See _A_L_S_A _a_u_d_i_o _o_u_t_p_u_t _o_p_t_i_o_n_s for options specific to this AO.

              WWAARRNNIINNGG::
                 To get multichannel/surround audio, use ----aauuddiioo--cchhaannnneellss==aauuttoo. The default  for  this
                 option  is  aauuttoo--ssaaffee,  which  makes this audio output explicitly reject multichannel
                 output, as there is no way to detect whether a certain  channel  layout  is  actually
                 supported.

                 You  can  also  try _u_s_i_n_g _t_h_e _u_p_m_i_x _p_l_u_g_i_n.  This setup enables multichannel audio on
                 the ddeeffaauulltt device with automatic upmixing with shared access, so playing stereo  and
                 multichannel audio at the same time will work as expected.

       oossss    OSS audio output driver

              The following global options are supported by this audio output:

              ----oossss--mmiixxeerr--ddeevviiccee
                     Sets the audio mixer device (default: //ddeevv//mmiixxeerr).

              ----oossss--mmiixxeerr--cchhaannnneell
                     Sets the audio mixer channel (default: ppccmm). Other valid values include vvooll,, ppccmm,,
                     lliinnee.  For  a  complete  list  of  options   look   for   SSOOUUNNDD__DDEEVVIICCEE__NNAAMMEESS   in

       jjaacckk   JACK (Jack Audio Connection Kit) audio output driver.

              The following global options are supported by this audio output:

              ----jjaacckk--ppoorrtt==<<nnaammee>>
                     Connects to the ports with the given name (default: physical ports).

              ----jjaacckk--nnaammee==<<cclliieenntt>>
                     Client  name  that  is  passed to JACK (default: mmppvv). Useful if you want to have
                     certain connections established automatically.

              ----jjaacckk--aauuttoossttaarrtt==<<yyeess||nnoo>>
                     Automatically start jackd if necessary (default: disabled). Note that this  tends
                     to be unreliable and will flood stdout with server messages.

              ----jjaacckk--ccoonnnneecctt==<<yyeess||nnoo>>
                     Automatically  create  connections  to  output  ports  (default:  enabled).  When
                     enabled, the maximum number of output channels will be limited to the  number  of
                     available output ports.

              ----jjaacckk--ssttdd--cchhaannnneell--llaayyoouutt==<<wwaavveeeexxtt||aannyy>>
                     Select  the standard channel layout (default: waveext). JACK itself has no notion
                     of channel layouts (i.e. assigning which speaker a given channel is  supposed  to
                     map  to)  -  it  just  takes whatever the application outputs, and reroutes it to
                     whatever the user defines. This means the user and the application are in  charge
                     of  dealing  with  the channel layout. wwaavveeeexxtt uses WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE order,
                     which, even though it was defined by Microsoft, is the standard on many  systems.
                     The  value  aannyy  makes  JACK  accept  whatever comes from the audio filter chain,
                     regardless of channel layout and without reordering. This mode  is  probably  not
                     very useful, other than for debugging or when used with fixed setups.

       ccoorreeaauuddiioo ((MMaacc OOSS XX oonnllyy))
              Native Mac OS X audio output driver using AudioUnits and the CoreAudio sound server.

              Automatically redirects to ccoorreeaauuddiioo__eexxcclluussiivvee when playing compressed formats.

              The following global options are supported by this audio output:

              ----ccoorreeaauuddiioo--cchhaannggee--pphhyyssiiccaall--ffoorrmmaatt==<<yyeess||nnoo>>
                     Change the physical format to one similar to the requested audio format (default:
                     no). This has the advantage that multichannel audio output  will  actually  work.
                     The  disadvantage  is that it will change the system-wide audio settings. This is
                     equivalent to changing the FFoorrmmaatt setting in the  AAuuddiioo  DDeevviicceess  dialog  in  the
                     AAuuddiioo  MMIIDDII  SSeettuupp  utility.  Note that this does not affect the selected speaker
                     setup.

              ----ccoorreeaauuddiioo--ssppddiiff--hhaacckk==<<yyeess||nnoo>>
                     Try to pass through AC3/DTS data as PCM. This is useful for drivers which do  not
                     report  AC3  support.  It  converts the AC3 data to float, and assumes the driver
                     will do the inverse conversion, which means a typical A/V receiver will  pick  it
                     up  as  compressed  IEC framed AC3 stream, ignoring that it's marked as PCM. This
                     disables normal AC3 passthrough (even if the device reports it as supported). Use
                     with extreme care.

       ccoorreeaauuddiioo__eexxcclluussiivvee ((MMaacc OOSS XX oonnllyy))
              Native  Mac  OS  X  audio  output  driver  using direct device access and exclusive mode
              (bypasses the sound server).

       ooppeennaall OpenAL audio output driver

              ----ooppeennaall--nnuumm--bbuuffffeerrss==<<22--112288>>
                     Specify the number of audio buffers to use. Lower values are better for lower CPU
                     usage. Default: 4.

              ----ooppeennaall--nnuumm--ssaammpplleess==<<225566--3322776688>>
                     Specify  the number of complete samples to use for each buffer. Higher values are
                     better for lower CPU usage. Default: 8192.

              ----ooppeennaall--ddiirreecctt--cchhaannnneellss==<<yyeess||nnoo>>
                     Enable OpenAL Soft's direct channel extension when available to avoid tinting the
                     sound  with  ambisonics  or  HRTF.   Channels  are dropped when when they are not
                     available as downmixing will be disabled. Default: no.

       ppuullssee  PulseAudio audio output driver

              The following global options are supported by this audio output:

              ----ppuullssee--hhoosstt==<<hhoosstt>>
                     Specify the host to use. An empty <host> string uses a local connection,  "local‐
                     host" uses network transfer (most likely not what you want).

              ----ppuullssee--bbuuffffeerr==<<11--22000000||nnaattiivvee>>
                     Set  the audio buffer size in milliseconds. A higher value buffers more data, and
                     has a lower probability of buffer underruns. A  smaller  value  makes  the  audio
                     stream react faster, e.g. to playback speed changes.

              ----ppuullssee--llaatteennccyy--hhaacckkss==<<yyeess||nnoo>>
                     Enable  hacks to workaround PulseAudio timing bugs (default: no). If enabled, mpv
                     will do elaborate latency calculations on its  own.  If  disabled,  it  will  use
                     PulseAudio  automatically  updated  timing information. Disabling this might help
                     with e.g. networked audio or some plugins, while enabling it might help  in  some
                     unknown situations (it used to be required to get good behavior on old PulseAudio
                     versions).

                     If you have stuttering video when using pulse, try to enable this option. (Or try
                     to update PulseAudio.)

       ssddll    SDL  1.2+ audio output driver. Should work on any platform supported by SDL 1.2, but may
              require the SSDDLL__AAUUDDIIOODDRRIIVVEERR environment variable to be set appropriately for  your  sys‐
              tem.

              NNOOTTEE::
                 This driver is for compatibility with extremely foreign environments, such as systems
                 where none of the other drivers are available.

              The following global options are supported by this audio output:

              ----ssddll--bbuufflleenn==<<lleennggtthh>>
                     Sets the audio buffer length in seconds. Is used only as a hint by the sound sys‐
                     tem.  Playing  a  file  with --vv will show the requested and obtained exact buffer
                     size. A value of 0 selects the sound system default.

              ----ssddll--bbuuffccnntt==<<ccoouunntt>>
                     Sets the number of extra audio buffers in mpv. Usually needs not be changed.

       nnuullll   Produces no audio output but maintains video  playback  speed.  You  can  use  ----aaoo==nnuullll
              ----aaoo--nnuullll--uunnttiimmeedd for benchmarking.

              The following global options are supported by this audio output:

              ----aaoo--nnuullll--uunnttiimmeedd
                     Do  not simulate timing of a perfect audio device. This means audio decoding will
                     go as fast as possible, instead of timing it to the system clock.

              ----aaoo--nnuullll--bbuuffffeerr
                     Simulated buffer length in seconds.

              ----aaoo--nnuullll--oouuttbbuurrsstt
                     Simulated chunk size in samples.

              ----aaoo--nnuullll--ssppeeeedd
                     Simulated audio playback speed as a multiplier. Usually, a real audio device will
                     not  go  exactly  as fast as the system clock. It will deviate just a little, and
                     this option helps to simulate this.

              ----aaoo--nnuullll--llaatteennccyy
                     Simulated device latency. This is additional to EOF.

              ----aaoo--nnuullll--bbrrookkeenn--eeooff
                     Simulate broken audio drivers, which always add the fixed device latency  to  the
                     reported audio playback position.

              ----aaoo--nnuullll--bbrrookkeenn--ddeellaayy
                     Simulate broken audio drivers, which don't report latency correctly.

              ----aaoo--nnuullll--cchhaannnneell--llaayyoouuttss
                     If  not  empty, this is a ,, separated list of channel layouts the AO allows. This
                     can be used to test channel layout selection.

              ----aaoo--nnuullll--ffoorrmmaatt
                     Force the audio output format the AO will accept. If unset accepts any.

       ppccmm    Raw PCM/WAVE file writer audio output

              The following global options are supported by this audio output:

              ----aaoo--ppccmm--wwaavveehheeaaddeerr==<<yyeess||nnoo>>
                     Include or do not include the WAVE header (default: included). When not included,
                     raw PCM will be generated.

              ----aaoo--ppccmm--ffiillee==<<ffiilleennaammee>>
                     Write  the  sound to <<ffiilleennaammee>> instead of the default aauuddiioodduummpp..wwaavv. If nnoo--wwaavvee‐‐
                     hheeaaddeerr is specified, the default is aauuddiioodduummpp..ppccmm.

              ----aaoo--ppccmm--aappppeenndd==<<yyeess||nnoo>>
                     Append to the file, instead of overwriting it. Always use this with the  nnoo--wwaavvee‐‐
                     hheeaaddeerr  option - with wwaavveehheeaaddeerr it's broken, because it will write a WAVE header
                     every time the file is opened.

       rrssoouunndd Audio output to an RSound daemon. Use ----aauuddiioo--ddeevviiccee==rrssoouunndd//<<hhoossttnnaammee>> to set  the  host

       Video output drivers are interfaces to different video output facilities. The syntax is:

       ----vvoo==<<ddrriivveerr11,,ddrriivveerr22,,......[[,,]]>>
              Specify a priority list of video output drivers to be used.

       If the list has a trailing ,,, mpv will fall back on drivers not contained in the list.

       NNOOTTEE::
          See ----vvoo==hheellpp for a list of compiled-in video output drivers.

          The recommended output driver is ----vvoo==ggppuu, which is the default. All other drivers  are  for
          compatibility  or  special purposes. If the default does not work, it will fallback to other
          drivers (in the same order as listed by ----vvoo==hheellpp).

       Available video output drivers are:

       xxvv ((XX1111 oonnllyy))
              Uses the XVideo extension to enable hardware-accelerated display. This is the most  com‐
              patible VO on X, but may be low-quality, and has issues with OSD and subtitle display.

              NNOOTTEE::
                 This driver is for compatibility with old systems.

              ----xxvv--ppoorrtt==<<nnuummbbeerr>>
                     Select a specific XVideo port.

                     Select the source from which the color key is taken (default: cur).

                     ccuurr    The default takes the color key currently set in Xv.

                     uussee    Use  but  do  not set the color key from mpv (use the ----ccoolloorrkkeeyy option to
                            change it).

                     sseett    Same as use but also sets the supplied color key.

                     nnoonnee   Disables color-keying.

                     mmaann    Draw the color key manually (reduces flicker in some cases).

                     bbgg     Set the color key as window background.

                     aauuttoo   Let Xv draw the color key.

                     Changes the color key to an RGB value of  your  choice.  00xx000000000000  is  black  and
                     00xxffffffffffff is white.

              ----xxvv--bbuuffffeerrss==<<nnuummbbeerr>>
                     Number  of  image  buffers  to  use  for  the  internal  ringbuffer (default: 2).
                     Increasing this will use more memory, but  might  help  with  the  X  server  not
                     responding  quickly  enough  if  video FPS is close to or higher than the display
                     refresh rate.

                     NVIDIA's  current  VDPAU implementation behaves somewhat differently under a com‐
                     positing window manager and does not give accurate frame timing information. With
                     this option enabled, the player tries to detect whether a compositing window man‐
                     ager is active. If one is detected, the player disables timing adjustments as  if
                     the  user  had specified ffppss==--11 (as they would be based on incorrect input). This
                     means timing is somewhat less accurate than without  compositing,  but  with  the
                     composited  mode  behavior  of the NVIDIA driver, there is no hard playback speed
                     limit even without the disabled logic. Enabled by default, use ----vvoo--vvddppaauu--ccoommppooss‐‐

                     Use  VDPAU's presentation queue functionality to queue future video frame changes
                     at most this many milliseconds in advance (default: 50).   See  below  for  addi‐
                     tional information.

                     Allocate  this  many  output  surfaces  to display video frames (default: 3). See
                     below for additional information.

                     Set the VDPAU presentation queue background color, which in practice is the  col‐
                     orkey  used  if  VDPAU  operates in overlay mode (default: ##002200550077, some shade of
                     black). If the alpha component of this value is 0,  the  default  VDPAU  colorkey
                     will be used instead (which is usually green).

                     Never  accept RGBA input. This means mpv will insert a filter to convert to a YUV
                     format before the VO. Sometimes useful to force availability of certain  YUV-only
                     features, like video equalizer or deinterlacing.

              Using  the  VDPAU  frame queuing functionality controlled by the queuetime options makes
              mpv's frame flip timing less sensitive to system CPU load and allows mpv to start decod‐
              ing  the  next  frame(s)  slightly earlier, which can reduce jitter caused by individual
              slow-to-decode frames. However, the NVIDIA graphics drivers can make other window behav‐
              ior  such as window moves choppy if VDPAU is using the blit queue (mainly happens if you
              have the composite extension enabled) and this feature is active.  If  this  happens  on
              your system and it bothers you then you can set the queuetime value to 0 to disable this
              feature. The settings to use in windowed and fullscreen mode are separate because  there
              should  be no reason to disable this for fullscreen mode (as the driver issue should not
              affect the video itself).

              You can queue more frames ahead by increasing the queuetime values and  the  oouuttppuutt__ssuurr‐‐
              ffaacceess count (to ensure enough surfaces to buffer video for a certain time ahead you need
              at least as many surfaces as the video has frames during  that  time,  plus  two).  This
              could help make video smoother in some cases. The main downsides are increased video RAM
              requirements for the surfaces and laggier display response  to  user  commands  (display
              changes  only become visible some time after they're queued). The graphics driver imple‐
              mentation may also have limits on the length of maximum queuing time or number of queued
              surfaces that work well or at all.

       ggppuu    General purpose, customizable, GPU-accelerated video output driver. It supports extended
              scaling methods, dithering, color management, custom shaders, HDR, and more.

              See _G_P_U _r_e_n_d_e_r_e_r _o_p_t_i_o_n_s for options specific to this VO.

              By default, it tries to use fast and fail-safe settings. Use the ggppuu--hhqq profile  to  use
              this driver with defaults set to high quality rendering. The profile can be applied with
              ----pprrooffiillee==ggppuu--hhqq and its contents can be viewed with ----sshhooww--pprrooffiillee==ggppuu--hhqq.

              This VO abstracts over several possible graphics APIs and windowing contexts, which  can
              be influenced using the ----ggppuu--aappii and ----ggppuu--ccoonntteexxtt options.

              Hardware  decoding  over  OpenGL-interop  is supported to some degree. Note that in this
              mode, some corner case might not be gracefully handled, and color space  conversion  and
              chroma upsampling is generally in the hand of the hardware decoder APIs.

              ggppuu  makes  use  of FBOs by default. Sometimes you can achieve better quality or perfor‐
              mance by changing the ----ggppuu--ffbboo--ffoorrmmaatt option to rrggbb1166ff, rrggbb3322ff or rrggbb.  Known  problems
              include  Mesa/Intel  not  accepting  rrggbb1166, Mesa sometimes not being compiled with float
              texture support, and some OS X setups being very slow with rrggbb1166 but fast  with  rrggbb3322ff.
              If you have problems, you can also try enabling the ----ggppuu--dduummbb--mmooddee==yyeess option.

       ssddll    SDL 2.0+ Render video output driver, depending on system with or without hardware accel‐

              copy of the file SSDDLL__hhiinnttss..hh.

              NNOOTTEE::
                 This  driver  is  for  compatibility  with systems that don't provide proper graphics
                 drivers, or which support GLES only.

              The following global options are supported by this video output:

              ----ssddll--ssww
                     Continue even if a software renderer is detected.

       vvaaaappii  Intel VA API video output driver with support for hardware decoding. Note that there  is
              absolutely  no  reason  to use this, other than compatibility.  This is low quality, and
              has issues with OSD.

              NNOOTTEE::
                 This driver is for compatibility with crappy systems.  You  can  use  vaapi  hardware
                 decoding with ----vvoo==ggppuu too.

                            Driver default (mpv default as well).

                     ffaasstt   Fast, but low quality.

                     Select  deinterlacing  algorithm. Note that by default deinterlacing is initially
                     always off, and needs to be enabled with the dd key (default key binding for ccyyccllee
                     ddeeiinntteerrllaaccee).

                     This option doesn't apply if libva supports video post processing (vpp).  In this
                     case, the default for ddeeiinntt--mmooddee is  nnoo,  and  enabling  deinterlacing  via  user
                     interaction  using  the  methods mentioned above actually inserts the vvaavvpppp video
                     filter. If vpp is not actually supported with the libva backend in use,  you  can
                     use this option to forcibly enable VO based deinterlacing.

                     nnoo     Don't allow deinterlacing (default for newer libva).

                     If  enabled,  then  the OSD is rendered at video resolution and scaled to display
                     resolution. By default, this is disabled, and the OSD is rendered at display res‐
                     olution if the driver supports it.

       nnuullll   Produces no video output. Useful for benchmarking.

              Usually, it's better to disable video with ----nnoo--vviiddeeoo instead.

              The following global options are supported by this video output:

                     Simulate display FPS. This artificially limits how many frames the VO accepts per
                     second.

              it requires an ansi terminal such as mintty.

                     Assume the terminal has the  specified  character  width  and/or  height.   These
                     default to 80x25 if the terminal size cannot be determined.

       lliibbmmppvv For  use with libmpv direct embedding. As a special case, on OS X it is used like a nor‐
              mal VO within mpv (cocoa-cb). Otherwise useless in any other contexts.   (See  <<mmppvv//rreenn‐‐
              ddeerr..hh>>.)

              This also supports many of the options the ggppuu VO has, depending on the backend.

       rrppii ((RRaassppbbeerrrryy PPii))
              Native video output on the Raspberry Pi using the MMAL API.

              This  is  deprecated.  Use  ----vvoo==ggppuu instead, which is the default and provides the same
              functionality. The rrppii VO will be removed in mpv 0.23.0. Its  functionality  was  folded
              into --vo=gpu, which now uses RPI hardware decoding by treating it as a hardware overlay
              (without applying GL filtering). Also to be changed in 0.23.0: the  --fs  flag  will  be
              reset to "no" by default (like on the other platforms).

              The following deprecated global options are supported by this video output:

              ----rrppii--ddiissppllaayy==<<nnuummbbeerr>>
                     Select  the  display  number on which the video overlay should be shown (default:
                     0).

              ----rrppii--llaayyeerr==<<nnuummbbeerr>>
                     Select the dispmanx layer on which the video overlay should  be  shown  (default:
                     -10).  Note that mpv will also use the 2 layers above the selected layer, to han‐
                     dle the window background and OSD. Actual video  rendering  will  happen  on  the
                     layer above the selected layer.

                     Whether  to  render  a black background behind the video (default: no).  Normally
                     it's better to kill the console framebuffer instead, which gives  better  perfor‐
                     mance.

              ----rrppii--oossdd==<<yyeess||nnoo>>
                     Enabled  by  default.  If  disabled  with nnoo, no OSD layer is created.  This also
                     means there will be no subtitles rendered.

              Video output driver using Kernel Mode Setting / Direct  Rendering  Manager.   Should  be
              used when one doesn't want to install full-blown graphical environment (e.g. no X). Does
              not support hardware acceleration (if you need this, check the ddrrmm backend for ggppuu VO).

                     Select  the  DRM  plane  index  to use for OSD (or OSD and video).  Index is zero
                     based, and related to crtc.  When using this option with the drm_prime  renderer,
                     it  will  only  affect the OSD contents. Otherwise it will set OSD & video plane.

                     Select  the  DRM format to use (default: xrgb8888). This allows you to choose the
                     bit depth of the DRM mode. xrgb8888 is your usual 24 bit  per  pixel/8  bits  per
                     channel  packed  RGB  format  with 8 bits of padding.  xrgb2101010 is a packed 30
                     bits per pixel/10 bits per channel packed RGB format with 2 bits of padding.

                     Unless you have an intel graphics card, a recent kernel and a recent  version  of
                     mesa (>=18) xrgb2101010 is unlikely to work for you.

                     This currently only has an effect when used together with the ddrrmm backend for the
                     ggppuu VO. The ddrrmm VO always uses xrgb8888.

                     Sets the OSD OpenGL size to the specified size. OSD will then be upscaled to  the
                     current screen resolution. This option can be useful when using several layers in
                     high resolutions with a GPU which cannot handle it.  Note : this option  is  only
                     available with DRM atomic support.  (default: display resolution)

          To get a full list of available audio filters, see ----aaff==hheellpp.

          Also, keep in mind that most actual filters are available via the llaavvffii wrapper, which gives
          you access to most of libavfilter's filters. This includes all filters that have been ported
          from MPlayer to libavfilter.

          The ----vvff description describes how libavfilter can be used and how to workaround  deprecated
          mpv filters.

              This filter uses libavresample (or libswresample, depending on the build) to change sam‐
              ple rate, sample format, or channel layout of the audio stream.  This filter is automat‐
              ically enabled if the audio output does not support the audio configuration of the  file

                     The bitrate use for the AC-3 stream. Set it to 384 to get 384 kbps.

                     The default is 640. Some receivers might not be able to handle this.

                     Valid values: 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 160, 192, 224, 256, 320, 384,

              eennccooddeerr==<<nnaammee>>
                     Select the libavcodec encoder used. Currently, this should be  an  AC-3  encoder,
                     and using another codec will fail horribly.

              Does  not  do  any  format  conversion itself. Rather, it may cause the filter system to
              insert necessary conversion filters before or after this filter if needed. It is primar‐
              ily  useful  for  controlling  the audio format going into other filters. To specify the
              format for audio output, see ----aauuddiioo--ffoorrmmaatt, ----aauuddiioo--ssaammpplleerraattee,  and  ----aauuddiioo--cchhaannnneellss.
              This filter is able to force a particular format, whereas ----aauuddiioo--** may be overridden by
              the ao based on output compatibility.

              All parameters are optional. The first 3 parameters restrict what the filter accepts  as
              input. They will therefore cause conversion filters to be inserted before this one.  The
              oouutt-- parameters tell the filters or audio outputs following this filter how to interpret
              the  data  without  actually  doing a conversion. Setting these will probably just break
              things unless you really know you want this for some reason, such as testing or  dealing
              with broken media.

              <<ffoorrmmaatt>>
                     Force  conversion  to  this  format. Use ----aaff==ffoorrmmaatt==ffoorrmmaatt==hheellpp to get a list of
                     valid formats.

              <<ssrraattee>>
                     Force conversion to a specific sample rate. The rate is  an  integer,  48000  for
                     example.

              <<cchhaannnneellss>>
                     Force mixing to a specific channel layout. See ----aauuddiioo--cchhaannnneellss option for possi‐
                     ble values.

              _N_O_T_E: this filter used to be named ffoorrccee. The old ffoorrmmaatt filter used  to  do  conversion

              Scales  audio  tempo  without  altering  pitch,  optionally  synced  to  playback  speed
              (default).

              This works by playing 'stride' ms of audio at normal speed then consuming 'stride*scale'
              ms  of input audio. It pieces the strides together by blending 'overlap'% of stride with
              audio following the previous stride. It optionally performs a short statistical analysis
              on the next 'search' ms of audio to determine the best overlap position.

              ssccaallee==<<aammoouunntt>>
                     Nominal amount to scale tempo. Scales this amount in addition to speed. (default:

              ssttrriiddee==<<aammoouunntt>>
                     Length in milliseconds to output each stride. Too high  of  a  value  will  cause
                     noticeable skips at high scale amounts and an echo at low scale amounts. Very low
                     values will alter pitch. Increasing improves performance. (default: 60)

              oovveerrllaapp==<<ppeerrcceenntt>>
                     Percentage of stride to overlap. Decreasing improves performance.  (default: .20)

              sseeaarrcchh==<<aammoouunntt>>
                     Length in milliseconds to search for best overlap position.  Decreasing  improves
                     performance  greatly.  On  slow  systems, you will probably want to set this very
                     low. (default: 14)

       rruubbbbeerrbbaanndd
              High quality pitch  correction  with  librubberband.  This  can  be  used  in  place  of
              ssccaalleetteemmppoo,  and will be used to adjust audio pitch when playing at speed different from
              normal. It can also be used to adjust audio pitch without changing playback speed.

              <<ppiittcchh--ssccaallee>>
                     Sets the pitch scaling factor. Frequencies are multiplied by this value.

              This filter has a number of additional sub-options. You can list them with mmppvv ----aaff==rruubb‐‐
              bbeerrbbaanndd==hheellpp.  This  will  also show the default values for each option. The options are
              not documented here, because they are  merely  passed  to  librubberband.  Look  at  the
              librubberband      documentation     to     learn     what     each     option     does:
              _h_t_t_p_:_/_/_b_r_e_a_k_f_a_s_t_q_u_a_y_._c_o_m_/_r_u_b_b_e_r_b_a_n_d_/_c_o_d_e_-_d_o_c_/_c_l_a_s_s_R_u_b_b_e_r_B_a_n_d___1___1_R_u_b_b_e_r_B_a_n_d_S_t_r_e_t_c_h_e_r_._h_t_m_l
              (The  mapping  of  the  mpv  rubberband  filter  sub-option names and values to those of
              librubberband follows a simple pattern: ""OOppttiioonn"" ++ NNaammee ++ VVaalluuee.)

              This filter supports the following aaff--ccoommmmaanndd commands:

              sseett--ppiittcchh
                     Set the <<ppiittcchh--ssccaallee>> argument dynamically. This can be used to change the  play‐
                     back  pitch  at  runtime.  Note that speed is controlled using the standard ssppeeeedd
                     property, not aaff--ccoommmmaanndd.

              mmuullttiippllyy--ppiittcchh <<ffaaccttoorr>>
                     Multiply the current value of <<ppiittcchh--ssccaallee>> dynamically.  For example: 0.5 to  go
                     down by an octave, 1.5 to go up by a perfect fifth.  If you want to go up or down
                     by semi-tones, use 1.059463094352953 and 0.9438743126816935

       llaavvffii==ggrraapphh
              Filter audio using FFmpeg's libavfilter.

              <<ggrraapphh>>
                     Libavfilter graph. See llaavvffii video filter for details - the graph syntax  is  the
                     same.

                     WWAARRNNIINNGG::
                        Don't  forget to quote libavfilter graphs as described in the lavfi video fil‐
                        ter section.

              oo==<<ssttrriinngg>>
                     AVOptions.

              ffiixx--ppttss==<<yyeess||nnoo>>
                     Determine PTS based on sample count (default: no). If this is enabled, the player
                     won't  rely  on  libavfilter  passing through PTS accurately.  Instead, it pass a
                     sample count as PTS to libavfilter, and compute the PTS used by mpv based on that
                     and  the input PTS. This helps with filters which output a recomputed PTS instead
                     of the original PTS (including filters which require the PTS to start at 0).  mpv
                     normally  expects filters to not touch the PTS (or only to the extent of changing
                     frame boundaries), so this is not the default, but it will be needed to use  bro‐
                     ken  filters. In practice, these broken filters will either cause slow A/V desync
                     over time (with some files), or break playback completely if you  seek  or  start
                     playback from the middle of a file.

VVIIDDEEOO FFIILLTTEERRSS
       Video  filters  allow you to modify the video stream and its properties. All of the information
       described in this section applies to audio filters as well (generally  using  the  prefix  ----aaff
       instead of ----vvff).

       The exact syntax is:

       ----vvff==<<ffiilltteerr11[[==ppaarraammeetteerr11::ppaarraammeetteerr22::......]],,ffiilltteerr22,,......>>
              Setup  a chain of video filters. This consists on the filter name, and an option list of
              parameters after ==. The parameters are separated by :: (not ,,, as that starts a new  fil‐
              ter entry).

              Before the filter name, a label can be specified with @@nnaammee::, where name is an arbitrary
              user-given name, which identifies the filter. This is only needed if you want to  toggle
              the filter at runtime.

              A  !!  before the filter name means the filter is disabled by default. It will be skipped
              on filter creation. This is also useful for runtime filter toggling.

              See the vvff command (and ttooggggllee sub-command) for further explanations and examples.

              The general filter entry syntax is:
                 [[""@@""<<llaabbeell--nnaammee>>""::""]] [[""!!""]] <<ffiilltteerr--nnaammee>> [[ ""=="" <<ffiilltteerr--ppaarraammeetteerr--lliisstt>> ]]

              or for the special "toggle" syntax (see vvff command):
                 ""@@""<<llaabbeell--nnaammee>>

              and the ffiilltteerr--ppaarraammeetteerr--lliisstt:
                 <<ffiilltteerr--ppaarraammeetteerr>> || <<ffiilltteerr--ppaarraammeetteerr>> "",,"" <<ffiilltteerr--ppaarraammeetteerr--lliisstt>>

              and ffiilltteerr--ppaarraammeetteerr:
                 (( <<ppaarraamm--nnaammee>> ""=="" <<ppaarraamm--vvaalluuee>> )) || <<ppaarraamm--vvaalluuee>>

              ppaarraamm--vvaalluuee can further be quoted in [[ / ]] in case the value contains characters like  ,,
              or ==. This is used in particular with the llaavvffii filter, which uses a very similar syntax
              as mpv (MPlayer historically) to specify filters and their parameters.

       Filters can be manipulated at run time. You can use @@ labels as described above in  combination
       with  the  vvff command (see _C_O_M_M_A_N_D _I_N_T_E_R_F_A_C_E) to get more control over this. Initially disabled
       filters with !! are useful for this as well.

       You can also set defaults for each filter. The defaults are applied before  the  normal  filter
       parameters. This is deprecated and never worked for the libavfilter bridge.

       ----vvff--ddeeffaauullttss==<<ffiilltteerr11[[==ppaarraammeetteerr11::ppaarraammeetteerr22::......]],,ffiilltteerr22,,......>>
              Set defaults for each filter. (Deprecated. ----aaff--ddeeffaauullttss is deprecated as well.)

       NNOOTTEE::
          To    get    a    full    list    of    available   video   filters,   see   ----vvff==hheellpp   and
          _h_t_t_p_:_/_/_f_f_m_p_e_g_._o_r_g_/_f_f_m_p_e_g_-_f_i_l_t_e_r_s_._h_t_m_l .

          Also, keep in mind that most actual filters are available via the llaavvffii wrapper, which gives
          you access to most of libavfilter's filters. This includes all filters that have been ported
          from MPlayer to libavfilter.

          Most builtin filters are deprecated in some ways, unless they're only available in mpv (such
          as filters which deal with mpv specifics, or which are implemented in mpv only).

          If  a  filter is not builtin, the llaavvffii--bbrriiddggee will be automatically tried. This bridge does
          not support help output, and does not verify parameters before the filter is actually  used.
          Although  the mpv syntax is rather similar to libavfilter's, it's not the same. (Which means
          not everything accepted by vf_lavfi's ggrraapphh option will be accepted by ----vvff.)

          You can also prefix the filter name with llaavvffii-- to force the wrapper.  This  is  helpful  if
          the   filter   name   collides   with   a   deprecated   mpv  builtin  filter.  For  example
          ----vvff==llaavvffii--ssccaallee==aarrggss would use libavfilter's ssccaallee filter  over  mpv's  deprecated  builtin
          one.

       Video filters are managed in lists. There are a few commands to manage the filter list.

       ----vvff--aadddd==ffiilltteerr
              Appends  the  filter given as arguments to the filter list. (Passing multiple filters is
              currently still possible, but deprecated.)

       ----vvff--pprree==ffiilltteerr
              Prepends the filters given as arguments to the filter list. (Passing multiple filters is
              currently still possible, but deprecated.)

       ----vvff--ddeell==ffiilltteerr
              Deletes  the filter. The filter can even given the way it was added (filter name and its
              full argument list), by label (prefixed with @@), or as index number. Index numbers start
              at  0,  negative numbers address the end of the list (-1 is the last). (Passing multiple
              filters is currently still possible, but deprecated.)

       ----vvff--ccllrr
              Completely empties the filter list.

       With filters that support it, you can access parameters by their name.

       ----vvff==<<ffiilltteerr>>==hheellpp
              Prints the parameter names and parameter value ranges for a particular filter.

       Available mpv-only filters are:

       ffoorrmmaatt==ffmmtt==<<vvaalluuee>>::ccoolloorrmmaattrriixx==<<vvaalluuee>>::......
              Restricts the color space for  the  next  filter  without  doing  any  conversion.   Use
              together with the scale filter for a real conversion.

              NNOOTTEE::
                 For a list of available formats, see ffoorrmmaatt==ffmmtt==hheellpp.

              <<ffmmtt>>  Format name, e.g. rgb15, bgr24, 420p, etc. (default: don't change).

              <<ccoolloorrmmaattrriixx>>
                     Controls the YUV to RGB color space conversion when playing video. There are var‐
                     ious standards. Normally, BT.601 should be used for SD video, and BT.709  for  HD
                     video. (This is done by default.) Using incorrect color space results in slightly
                     under or over saturated and shifted colors.

                     These options are not always supported. Different video outputs  provide  varying
                     degrees  of  support.  The  ggppuu and vvddppaauu video output drivers usually offer full
                     support. The xxvv output can set the color space if the system  video  driver  sup‐
                     ports  it,  but not input and output levels. The ssccaallee video filter can configure
                     color space and input levels, but only if the output format is RGB (if the  video
                     output  driver  supports  RGB  output,  you  can  force  this with --vvff ssccaallee,,ffoorr‐‐
                     mmaatt==rrggbbaa).

                     If this option is set to aauuttoo (which is the default),  the  video's  color  space
                     flag  will be used. If that flag is unset, the color space will be selected auto‐
                     matically. This is done using a simple heuristic that attempts to distinguish  SD
                     and  HD  video.  If the video is larger than 1279x576 pixels, BT.709 (HD) will be
                     used; otherwise BT.601 (SD) is selected.

                     Available color spaces are:

                     aauuttoo   automatic selection (default)

                     bbtt..660011 ITU-R BT.601 (SD)

              <<ccoolloorrlleevveellss>>
                     YUV color levels used with YUV to RGB conversion. This option is  only  necessary
                     when  playing broken files which do not follow standard color levels or which are
                     flagged wrong. If the video does not specify its color range, it is assumed to be
                     limited range.

                     The same limitations as with <<ccoolloorrmmaattrriixx>> apply.

                     Available color ranges are:

                     aauuttoo   automatic selection (normally limited range) (default)

                     lliimmiitteedd
                            limited range (16-235 for luma, 16-240 for chroma)

                     ffuullll   full range (0-255 for both luma and chroma)

              <<pprriimmaarriieess>>
                     RGB  primaries  the  source file was encoded with. Normally this should be set in
                     the file header, but when playing broken or mistagged files this can be  used  to
                     override the setting.

                     This  option only affects video output drivers that perform color management, for
                     example ggppuu with the ttaarrggeett--pprriimm or iicccc--pprrooffiillee suboptions set.

                     If this option is set to aauuttoo (which is the default), the video's primaries  flag
                     will  be  used. If that flag is unset, the color space will be selected automati‐
                     cally, using the following heuristics: If the <<ccoolloorrmmaattrriixx>> is set or  determined
                     as  BT.2020  or  BT.709,  the corresponding primaries are used. Otherwise, if the
                     video height is exactly 576 (PAL), BT.601-625 is used. If it's exactly 480 or 486
                     (NTSC),  BT.601-525  is used. If the video resolution is anything else, BT.709 is
                     used.

                        If  you want to use the full filter syntax with this option, you have to quote
                        the filter graph in order to prevent mpv's syntax and the filter graph  syntax
                        from  clashing.  To  prevent  a  quoting  and  escaping  mess,  consider using
                        ----llaavvffii--ccoommpplleexx if you know which video track you want to use from  the  input
                        file. (There is only one video track for nearly all video files anyway.)

                        Examples

                               (This demonstrates how libavfilter takes a graph and not just a  single
                               filter.)  The filter graph string is quoted with [[ and ]]. This requires
                               no additional quoting or escaping with some shells (like  bash),  while
                               others (like zsh) require additional "" quotes around the option string.

                               Same  as  before, but uses quoting that should be safe with all shells.
                               The outer '' quotes make sure that the  shell  does  not  remove  the  ""
                               quotes needed by mpv.

                               Same as before, but uses named parameters for everything.

              <<sswwss--ffllaaggss>>
                     If libavfilter inserts filters for pixel format conversion, this option gives the
                     flags which should be passed to libswscale. This option is numeric  and  takes  a
                     bit-wise combination of SSWWSS__ flags.

                     Adds a black band at the bottom of the frame. The SSA/ASS renderer can place sub‐

                 Examples

                        Moves  sub  rendering before the eq filter. This will put both subtitle colors
                        and video under the influence of the video equalizer settings.

              Loads a VapourSynth filter script. This is intended for streamed processing:  mpv  actu‐
              ally  provides  a source filter, instead of using a native VapourSynth video source. The
              mpv source will answer frame requests only within a small window of frames (the size  of
              this  window  is controlled with the bbuuffffeerreedd--ffrraammeess parameter), and requests outside of
              that will return errors. As such, you can't use the full power of VapourSynth,  but  you
              can use certain filters.

              If  you  just  want  to  play  video  generated  by  a  VapourSynth (i.e. using a native
              VapourSynth video source), it's better to use vvssppiippee and a FIFO to  feed  the  video  to
              mpv.  The  same  applies  if  the  filter  script  requires  random  frame  access  (see
              bbuuffffeerreedd--ffrraammeess parameter).

              This filter is experimental. If it turns out that it works well and is used, it will  be
              ported to libavfilter. Otherwise, it will be just removed.

              ffiillee   Filename  of  the  script  source. Currently, this is always a python script. The
                     variable vviiddeeoo__iinn is set to the mpv video source, and it  is  expected  that  the
                     script  reads  video from it. (Otherwise, mpv will decode no video, and the video
                     packet queue will overflow, eventually  leading  to  audio  being  stopped.)  The
                     script  is  also  expected  to pass through timestamps using the __DDuurraattiioonnNNuumm and
                     __DDuurraattiioonnDDeenn frame properties.

                        Example:

                            import vapoursynth as vs
                            core = vs.get_core()

                        The script will be reloaded on every seek. This is done to  reset  the  filter

                     (default: 4). This specifies the maximum number of frames the script can  request
                     in  reverse  direction.  E.g. if bbuuffffeerreedd--ffrraammeess==55, and the script just requested
                     frame 15, it can still request frame 10, but frame 9 is  not  available  anymore.
                     If  it  requests  frame  30, mpv will decode 15 more frames, and keep only frames
                     25-30.

                     The actual number of buffered frames also depends on the  value  of  the  ccoonnccuurr‐‐
                     rreenntt--ffrraammeess option. Currently, both option values are multiplied to get the final
                     buffer size.

                     (Normally, VapourSynth source filters must provide random  access,  but  mpv  was
                     made  for  playback, and does not provide frame-exact random access. The way this
                     video filter works is a compromise to make simple filters work anyway.)

              ccoonnccuurrrreenntt--ffrraammeess
                     Number of frames that should be requested in parallel. The level  of  concurrency
                     depends  on  the  filter and how quickly mpv can decode video to feed the filter.
                     This value should probably be  proportional  to  the  number  of  cores  on  your
                     machine.  Most  time, making it higher than the number of cores can actually make
                     it slower.

                     By default, this uses the special value aauuttoo, which sets the option to the number
                     of detected logical CPU cores.

              The following variables are defined by mpv:

              vviiddeeoo__iinn
                     The mpv video source as vapoursynth clip. Note that this has no length set, which
                     confuses many filters. Using TTrriimm on the clip with a high dummy length  can  turn
                     it into a finite clip.

              vviiddeeoo__iinn__ddww,, vviiddeeoo__iinn__ddhh
                     Display size of the video. Can be different from video size if the video does not
                     use square pixels (e.g. DVD).

              ccoonnttaaiinneerr__ffppss
                     FPS value as reported by file headers. This value can be wrong or completely bro‐
                     ken  (e.g. 0 or NaN). Even if the value is correct, if another filter changes the
                     real FPS (by dropping or inserting frames), the value of this variable might  not
                     be useful. Note that the ----ffppss command line option overrides this value.

                     Useful for some filters which insist on having a FPS.

              ddiissppllaayy__ffppss
                     Refresh rate of the current display. Note that this value can be 0.

       vvaappoouurrssyynntthh--llaazzyy
              The  same  as  vvaappoouurrssyynntthh,  but  doesn't load Python scripts. Instead, a custom backend
              using Lua and the raw VapourSynth API is used. The syntax is completely  different,  and
              absolutely  no  convenience  features are provided. There's no type checking either, and
              you can trigger crashes.

                 Example:

                     video_out = invoke("morpho", "Open", {clip = video_in})

              The special variable vviiddeeoo__iinn is the  mpv  video  source,  while  the  special  variable
              vviiddeeoo__oouutt  is used to read video from. The 1st argument is the plugin (queried with ggeett‐‐
              PPlluuggiinnBByyNNss), the 2nd is the filter name, and the 3rd argument is a table with the  argu‐
              ments.  Positional  arguments are not supported. The types must match exactly. Since Lua
              is terrible and can't distinguish integers and floats, integer arguments  must  be  pre‐
              fixed  with ii__, in which case the prefix is removed and the argument is cast to an inte‐
              ger. Should the argument's name start with ii__, you're out of luck.

              Clips (VSNodeRef) are passed as light userdata, so trying to  pass  any  other  userdata
              type will result in hard crashes.

       vvaavvpppp  VA-AP-API  video  post  processing.  Works  with ----vvoo==vvaaaappii and ----vvoo==ggppuu only. Currently
              deinterlaces. This filter  is  automatically  inserted  if  deinterlacing  is  requested
              (either  using  the  dd  key,  by default mapped to the command ccyyccllee ddeeiinntteerrllaaccee, or the
              ----ddeeiinntteerrllaaccee option).

              ddeeiinntt==<<mmeetthhoodd>>

                     aauuttoo   Select the best quality deinterlacing algorithm (default).  This  goes  by
                            the order of the options as documented, with mmoottiioonn--ccoommppeennssaatteedd being con‐
                            sidered best quality.

                            Advanced deinterlacing algorithms. Whether these actually work depends  on
                            the GPU hardware, the GPU drivers, driver bugs, and mpv bugs.

                     yyeess    Only deinterlace frames marked as interlaced.

              rreevveerrssaall--bbuugg==<<yyeess||nnoo>>

                     nnoo     Use the API as it was interpreted by older Mesa drivers. While this inter‐
                            pretation was more obvious and inuitive, it was apparently wrong, and  not
                            shared by Intel driver developers.

                     yyeess    Use  Intel  interpretation  of  surface  forward  and backwards references
                            (default). This is what Intel drivers and newer Mesa drivers expect.  Mat‐
                            ters only for the advanced deinterlacing algorithms.

       vvddppaauupppp
              VDPAU  video  post  processing.  Works with ----vvoo==vvddppaauu and ----vvoo==ggppuu only. This filter is
              automatically inserted if deinterlacing is requested (either using the dd key, by default
              mapped  to  the  command  ccyyccllee ddeeiinntteerrllaaccee, or the ----ddeeiinntteerrllaaccee option). When enabling
              deinterlacing, it is always preferred over software deinterlacer filters if the vvddppaauu VO
              is used, and also if ggppuu is used and hardware decoding was activated at least once (i.e.
              vdpau was loaded).

              sshhaarrppeenn==<<--11--11>>
                     For positive values, apply a sharpening algorithm to the video, for negative val‐
                     ues a blurring algorithm (default: 0).

              ddeennooiissee==<<00--11>>
                     Apply a noise reduction algorithm to the video (default: 0; no noise reduction).

              ddeeiinntt==<<yyeess||nnoo>>
                     Whether  deinterlacing is enabled (default: no). If enabled, it will use the mode
                     selected with ddeeiinntt--mmooddee.

                     Select deinterlacing mode (default: temporal).

                     Note that there's currently a mechanism that allows the vvddppaauu VO  to  change  the
                     ddeeiinntt--mmooddee of auto-inserted vvddppaauupppp filters. To avoid confusion, it's recommended
                     not to use the ----vvoo==vvddppaauu suboptions related to filtering.

                     with slow video memory.

              Force the video stream to become the first stream in the output.  By default, the  order
              is unspecified. Deprecated.

       ----oorraawwttss
              Copies  input  pts  to the output video (not supported by some output container formats,
              e.g. AVI). In this mode, discontinuities are not fixed and all pts  are  passed  through
              as-is. Never seek backwards or use multiple input files in this mode!

       ----nnoo--ooccooppyy--mmeettaaddaattaa
              Turns  off  copying of metadata from input files to output files when encoding (which is
              enabled by default).

       ----oosseett--mmeettaaddaattaa==<<mmeettaaddaattaa--ttaagg[[,,mmeettaaddaattaa--ttaagg,,......]]>>
              Specifies metadata to include in the output file.  Supported keys  vary  between  output
              formats. For example, Matroska (MKV) and FLAC allow almost arbitrary keys, while support
              in MP4 and MP3 is more limited.

                 Example

                 ----oosseett--mmeettaaddaattaa==ttiittllee== OOuuttppuutt ttiittllee"",,ccoommmmeenntt==""AAnnootthheerr ttaagg""""
                        adds a title and a comment to the output file.

       ----oorreemmoovvee--mmeettaaddaattaa==<<mmeettaaddaattaa--ttaagg[[,,mmeettaaddaattaa--ttaagg,,......]]>>
              Specifies metadata to exclude from the output file when copying from the input file.

                 Example

                 ----oorreemmoovvee--mmeettaaddaattaa==ccoommmmeenntt,,ggeennrree
                        excludes copying of the the comment and genre tags to the output file.

CCOOMMMMAANNDD IINNTTEERRFFAACCEE
       The mpv core can be controlled with commands and properties. A number of ways to interact  with
       the player use them: key bindings (iinnppuutt..ccoonnff), OSD (showing information with properties), JSON
       IPC, the client API (lliibbmmppvv), and the classic slave mode.

   iinnppuutt..ccoonnff
       The input.conf file consists of a list of key bindings, for example:

          s screenshot      # take a screenshot with the s key
          LEFT seek 15      # map the left-arrow key to seeking forward by 15 seconds

       Each line maps a key to an input command. Keys are specified with their  literal  value  (upper
       case  if  combined  with  SShhiifftt),  or a name for special keys. For example, aa maps to the aa key
       without shift, and AA maps to aa with shift.

       The file is located in the mpv configuration directory  (normally  at  ~~//..ccoonnffiigg//mmppvv//iinnppuutt..ccoonnff
       depending on platform). The default bindings are defined here:

          https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/etc/input.conf

       A list of special keys can be obtained with
          mmppvv ----iinnppuutt--kkeeyylliisstt

       In general, keys can be combined with SShhiifftt, CCttrrll and AAlltt:

          ctrl+q quit

       mmppvv  can  be  started  in input test mode, which displays key bindings and the commands they're
       bound to on the OSD, instead of executing the commands:

          mpv --input-test --force-window --idle

       (Only closing the window will make mmppvv exit, pressing normal keys will merely display the bind‐
       ing, even if mapped to quit.)

   GGeenneerraall IInnppuutt CCoommmmaanndd SSyynnttaaxx
       [[SShhiifftt++]][[CCttrrll++]][[AAlltt++]][[MMeettaa++]]<<kkeeyy>>  [[{{<<sseeccttiioonn>>}}]]  [[<<pprreeffiixxeess>>]] <<ccoommmmaanndd>> ((<<aarrgguummeenntt>>))** [[;; <<ccoomm‐‐
       mmaanndd>>]]

       Note that by default, the right Alt key can be used to create special characters, and thus does
       not register as a modifier. The option ----nnoo--iinnppuutt--rriigghhtt--aalltt--ggrr changes this behavior.

       Newlines  always  start a new binding. ## starts a comment (outside of quoted string arguments).
       To bind commands to the ## key, SSHHAARRPP can be used.

       <<kkeeyy>> is either the literal character the key produces (ASCII or Unicode character), or a  sym‐
       bolic name (as printed by ----iinnppuutt--kkeeyylliisstt).

       <<sseeccttiioonn>> (braced with {{ and }}) is the input section for this command.

       Arguments are separated by whitespace. This applies even to string arguments.  For this reason,
       string arguments should be quoted with "". Inside quotes, C-style escaping can be used.

       You can bind multiple commands to one key. For example:
       a show-text "command 1" ; show-text "command 2"

       It's also possible to bind a command to a sequence of keys:
       a-b-c show-text "command run after a, b, c have been pressed"

       (This is not shown in the general command syntax.)

       If aa or aa--bb or bb are already bound, this will run the  first  command  that  matches,  and  the
       multi-key command will never be called. Intermediate keys can be remapped to iiggnnoorree in order to
       avoid this issue. The maximum number of (non-modifier) keys for combinations is currently 4.

   LLiisstt ooff IInnppuutt CCoommmmaannddss
       iiggnnoorree Use this to "block" keys that should be unbound, and do nothing.  Useful  for  disabling
              default bindings, without disabling all bindings with ----nnoo--iinnppuutt--ddeeffaauulltt--bbiinnddiinnggss.

       sseeeekk <<sseeccoonnddss>> [[rreellaattiivvee||aabbssoolluuttee||aabbssoolluuttee--ppeerrcceenntt||rreellaattiivvee--ppeerrcceenntt||eexxaacctt||kkeeyyffrraammeess]]
              Change the playback position. By default, seeks by a relative amount of seconds.

              The second argument consists of flags controlling the seek mode:

              rreellaattiivvee ((ddeeffaauulltt))
                     Seek relative to current position (a negative value seeks backwards).

              aabbssoolluuttee
                     Seek to a given time (a negative value starts from the end of the file).

              aabbssoolluuttee--ppeerrcceenntt
                     Seek to a given percent position.

              rreellaattiivvee--ppeerrcceenntt
                     Seek relative to current position in percent.

              kkeeyyffrraammeess
                     Always restart playback at keyframe boundaries (fast).

              eexxaacctt  Always do exact/hr/precise seeks (slow).

              Multiple flags can be combined, e.g.: aabbssoolluuttee++kkeeyyffrraammeess.

              By default, kkeeyyffrraammeess is used for relative seeks, and eexxaacctt is used for absolute seeks.

              Before  mpv 0.9, the kkeeyyffrraammeess and eexxaacctt flags had to be passed as 3rd parameter (essen‐
              tially using a space instead of ++). The 3rd parameter is still parsed, but is considered
              deprecated.

       rreevveerrtt--sseeeekk [[mmooddee]]
              Undoes  the  sseeeekk command, and some other commands that seek (but not necessarily all of
              them). Calling this command once will jump to the playback  position  before  the  seek.
              Calling it a second time undoes the rreevveerrtt--sseeeekk command itself. This only works within a
              single file.

              The first argument is optional, and can change the behavior:

              mmaarrkk   Mark the current time position. The next normal  rreevveerrtt--sseeeekk  command  will  seek
                     back to this point, no matter how many seeks happened since last time.

              Using it without any arguments gives you the default behavior.

       ffrraammee--sstteepp
              Play one frame, then pause. Does nothing with audio-only playback.

       ffrraammee--bbaacckk--sstteepp
              Go  back  by one frame, then pause. Note that this can be very slow (it tries to be pre‐
              cise, not fast), and sometimes fails to behave as expected. How well this works  depends
              on  whether  precise  seeking  works  correctly  (e.g.  see the ----hhrr--sseeeekk--ddeemmuuxxeerr--ooffffsseett
              option). Video filters or other video post-processing that  modifies  timing  of  frames
              (e.g.  deinterlacing)  should  usually work, but might make backstepping silently behave
              incorrectly in corner cases. Using ----hhrr--sseeeekk--ffrraammeeddrroopp==nnoo should help, although it might
              make precise seeking slower.

              This does not work with audio-only playback.

       sseett <<pprrooppeerrttyy>> <<vvaalluuee>>
              Set the given property to the given value.

       aadddd <<pprrooppeerrttyy>> [[<<vvaalluuee>>]]
              Add the given value to the property. On overflow or underflow, clamp the property to the
              maximum. If <<vvaalluuee>> is omitted, assume 11.

       ccyyccllee <<pprrooppeerrttyy>> [[uupp||ddoowwnn]]
              Cycle the given property. uupp and ddoowwnn set the cycle  direction.  On  overflow,  set  the
              property back to the minimum, on underflow set it to the maximum. If uupp or ddoowwnn is omit‐
              ted, assume uupp.

       mmuullttiippllyy <<pprrooppeerrttyy>> <<ffaaccttoorr>>
              Multiplies the value of a property with the numeric factor.

              Take a screenshot.

              Multiple flags are available (some can be combined with ++):

              <<ssuubbttiittlleess>> ((ddeeffaauulltt))
                     Save the video image, in its original resolution, and with subtitles.  Some video
                     outputs may still include the OSD in the output under certain circumstances.

              <<vviiddeeoo>>
                     Like  ssuubbttiittlleess,  but  typically  without  OSD  or  subtitles. The exact behavior
                     depends on the selected video output.

              <<wwiinnddooww>>
                     Save the contents of the mpv window. Typically scaled, with  OSD  and  subtitles.
                     The  exact  behavior  depends  on the selected video output, and if no support is
                     available, this will act like vviiddeeoo.

              <<eeaacchh--ffrraammee>>
                     Take a screenshot each frame. Issue this command again  to  stop  taking  screen‐
                     shots.  Note that you should disable frame-dropping when using this mode - or you
                     might receive duplicate images in cases when a frame was dropped. This  flag  can
                     be combined with the other flags, e.g. vviiddeeoo++eeaacchh--ffrraammee.

              Older  mpv  versions  required passing ssiinnggllee and eeaacchh--ffrraammee as second argument (and did
              not have flags). This syntax is still understood, but deprecated and might be removed in
              the future.

              Setting the aassyynncc flag will make encoding and writing the actual image file asynchronous
              in most cases. (eeaacchh--ffrraammee mode ignores this flag currently.) Requesting  async  screen‐
              shots  too  early  or too often could lead to the same filenames being chosen, and over‐
              writing each others in undefined order.

       ssccrreeeennsshhoott--ttoo--ffiillee <<ffiilleennaammee>> [[ssuubbttiittlleess||vviiddeeoo||wwiinnddooww]]
              Take a screenshot and save it to a given file. The format of the file will be guessed by
              the  extension  (and ----ssccrreeeennsshhoott--ffoorrmmaatt is ignored - the behavior when the extension is
              missing or unknown is arbitrary).

              The second argument is like the first argument to ssccrreeeennsshhoott.

              If the file already exists, it's overwritten.

              Like all input command parameters, the filename is  subject  to  property  expansion  as
              described in _P_r_o_p_e_r_t_y _E_x_p_a_n_s_i_o_n.

              The aassyynncc flag has an effect on this command (see ssccrreeeennsshhoott command).

       ppllaayylliisstt--nneexxtt [[wweeaakk||ffoorrccee]]

              ffoorrccee  Terminate playback if the first file is being played.

              Load the given file and play it.

              Second argument:

              <<rreeppllaaccee>> ((ddeeffaauulltt))
                     Stop playback of the current file, and play the new file immediately.

              <<aappppeenndd>>
                     Append the file to the playlist.

                     Append  the  file,  and if nothing is currently playing, start playback.  (Always
                     starts with the added file, even if the playlist was  not  empty  before  running
                     this command.)

              The third argument is a list of options and values which should be set while the file is
              playing. It is of the form oopptt11==vvaalluuee11,,oopptt22==vvaalluuee22,,.....  Not all options can  be  changed
              this way. Some options require a restart of the player.

              Load the given playlist file (like ----ppllaayylliisstt).

       ppllaayylliisstt--cclleeaarr
              Clear the playlist, except the currently played file.

              Remove  the  playlist  entry at the given index. Index values start counting with 0. The
              special value ccuurrrreenntt removes the current entry. Note that removing  the  current  entry
              also stops playback and starts playing the next entry.

       ppllaayylliisstt--mmoovvee <<iinnddeexx11>> <<iinnddeexx22>>
              Move  the  playlist  entry  at  index1,  so that it takes the place of the entry index2.
              (Paradoxically, the moved playlist entry will not have the index value index2 after mov‐
              ing  if index1 was lower than index2, because index2 refers to the target entry, not the
              index the entry will have after moving.)

       ppllaayylliisstt--sshhuuffffllee
              Shuffle the playlist. This is similar to what is done on start if the  ----sshhuuffffllee  option
              is used.

       rruunn ccoommmmaanndd aarrgg11 aarrgg22 ......
              Run the given command. Unlike in MPlayer/mplayer2 and earlier versions of mpv (0.2.x and
              older), this doesn't call the shell. Instead, the command is  run  directly,  with  each
              argument  passed  separately. Each argument is expanded like in _P_r_o_p_e_r_t_y _E_x_p_a_n_s_i_o_n. Note
              that there is a static limit of (as of this writing) 9 arguments (this  limit  could  be
              raised on demand).

              The  program  is run in a detached way. mpv doesn't wait until the command is completed,
              but continues playback right after spawning it.

              To get the old behavior, use //bbiinn//sshh and --cc as the first two arguments.

                 Example

                        rruunn ""//bbiinn//sshh"" ""--cc"" ""eecchhoo $${{ttiittllee}} >> //ttmmpp//ppllaayyiinngg""

                        This is not a particularly good example, because it doesn't  handle  escaping,
                        and  a  specially  prepared  file might allow an attacker to execute arbitrary
                        shell commands. It is recommended to write a small shell script, and call that
                        with rruunn.

       qquuiitt [[<<ccooddee>>]]
              Exit the player. If an argument is given, it's used as process exit code.

       qquuiitt--wwaattcchh--llaatteerr [[<<ccooddee>>]]
              Exit  player,  and store current playback position. Playing that file later will seek to
              the previous position on start. The (optional) argument is exactly as in the  qquuiitt  com‐
              mand.

       ssuubb--aadddd <<ffiillee>> [[<<ffllaaggss>> [[<<ttiittllee>> [[<<llaanngg>>]]]]]]
              Load the given subtitle file. It is selected as current subtitle after loading.

              The ffllaaggss args is one of the following values:

              <select>
                 Select the subtitle immediately.

              <auto>
                 Don't  select  the  subtitle.  (Or in some special situations, let the default stream
                 selection mechanism decide.)

              <cached>
                 Select the subtitle. If a subtitle with the same filename was already added, that one
                 is selected, instead of loading a duplicate entry.  (In this case, title/language are
                 ignored, and if the  was  changed  since  it  was  loaded,  these  changes  won't  be
                 reflected.)

              The ttiittllee argument sets the track title in the UI.

              The  llaanngg argument sets the track language, and can also influence stream selection with
              ffllaaggss set to aauuttoo.

       ssuubb--rreemmoovvee [[<<iidd>>]]
              Remove the given subtitle track. If the iidd  argument  is  missing,  remove  the  current
              track. (Works on external subtitle files only.)

       ssuubb--rreellooaadd [[<<iidd>>]]
              Reload  the  given  subtitle  tracks.  If the iidd argument is missing, reload the current
              track. (Works on external subtitle files only.)

              This works by unloading and re-adding the subtitle track.

       ssuubb--sstteepp <<sskkiipp>>
              Change subtitle timing such, that the subtitle event  after  the  next  <<sskkiipp>>  subtitle
              events is displayed. <<sskkiipp>> can be negative to step backwards.

       ssuubb--sseeeekk <<sskkiipp>>
              Seek  to  the  next  (skip set to 1) or the previous (skip set to -1) subtitle.  This is
              similar to ssuubb--sstteepp, except that it seeks video and audio instead of adjusting the  sub‐
              title delay.

              For  embedded  subtitles (like with Matroska), this works only with subtitle events that
              have already been displayed, or are within a short prefetch range.

       pprriinntt--tteexxtt <<ssttrriinngg>>
              Print text to stdout. The string can contain properties (see _P_r_o_p_e_r_t_y _E_x_p_a_n_s_i_o_n).

       sshhooww--tteexxtt <<ssttrriinngg>> [[<<dduurraattiioonn>>||--11 [[<<lleevveell>>]]]]
              Show text on the OSD. The string can contain properties, which are expanded as described
              in _P_r_o_p_e_r_t_y _E_x_p_a_n_s_i_o_n. This can be used to show playback time, filename, and so on.

              <<dduurraattiioonn>>
                     The  time  in  ms  to show the message for. By default, it uses the same value as
                     ----oossdd--dduurraattiioonn.

              <<lleevveell>>
                     The minimum OSD level to show the text at (see ----oossdd--lleevveell).

       eexxppaanndd--tteexxtt <<ssttrriinngg>>
              Property-expand the argument and return the expanded  string.  This  can  be  used  only
              through  the  client  API or from a script using mmpp..ccoommmmaanndd__nnaattiivvee. (see _P_r_o_p_e_r_t_y _E_x_p_a_n_‐
              _s_i_o_n).

       sshhooww--pprrooggrreessss
              Show the progress bar, the elapsed time and the total duration of the file on the OSD.

       wwrriittee--wwaattcchh--llaatteerr--ccoonnffiigg
              Write the resume config file that the  qquuiitt--wwaattcchh--llaatteerr  command  writes,  but  continue
              playback normally.

       ssttoopp   Stop  playback and clear playlist. With default settings, this is essentially like qquuiitt.
              Useful for the client API: playback can be stopped without terminating the player.

       mmoouussee <<xx>> <<yy>> [[<<bbuuttttoonn>> [[ssiinnggllee||ddoouubbllee]]]]
              Send a mouse event with given coordinate (<<xx>>, <<yy>>).

              Second argument:

              <<bbuuttttoonn>>
                     The button number of clicked mouse button. This should be one of 0-19.  If  <<bbuutt‐‐
                     ttoonn>> is omitted, only the position will be updated.

              Third argument:

              <<ssiinnggllee>> ((ddeeffaauulltt))
                     The mouse event represents regular single click.

              <<ddoouubbllee>>
                     The mouse event represents double-click.

       kkeeyypprreessss <<kkeeyy__nnaammee>>
              Send a key event through mpv's input handler, triggering whatever behavior is configured
              to that key. kkeeyy__nnaammee uses the iinnppuutt..ccoonnff naming scheme for keys and  modifiers.  Useful
              for the client API: key events can be sent to libmpv to handle internally.

       kkeeyyddoowwnn <<kkeeyy__nnaammee>>
              Similar  to kkeeyypprreessss, but sets the KKEEYYDDOOWWNN flag so that if the key is bound to a repeat‐
              able command, it will be run repeatedly with mpv's key repeat  timing  until  the  kkeeyyuupp
              command is called.

       kkeeyyuupp [[<<kkeeyy__nnaammee>>]]
              Set  the KKEEYYUUPP flag, stopping any repeated behavior that had been triggered. kkeeyy__nnaammee is
              optional. If kkeeyy__nnaammee is not given or is an empty string, KKEEYYUUPP will be set on all keys.
              Otherwise, KKEEYYUUPP will only be set on the key specified by kkeeyy__nnaammee.

              Load the given audio file. See ssuubb--aadddd command.

       aauuddiioo--rreemmoovvee [[<<iidd>>]]
              Remove the given audio track. See ssuubb--rreemmoovvee command.

       aauuddiioo--rreellooaadd [[<<iidd>>]]
              Reload the given audio tracks. See ssuubb--rreellooaadd command.

       rreessccaann--eexxtteerrnnaall--ffiilleess [[<<mmooddee>>]]
              Rescan  external  files  according  to the current ----ssuubb--aauuttoo and ----aauuddiioo--ffiillee--aauuttoo set‐
              tings. This can be used to auto-load external files _a_f_t_e_r the file was loaded.

              The mmooddee argument is one of the following:

              <<rreesseelleecctt>> ((ddeeffaauulltt))
                     Select the default audio and subtitle streams, which typically  selects  external
                     files  with the highest preference. (The implementation is not perfect, and could
                     be improved on request.)

              <<kkeeeepp--sseelleeccttiioonn>>
                     Do not change current track selections.

              Change audio filter chain. See vvff command.

       vvff sseett||aadddd||ttooggggllee||ddeell||ccllrr ffiilltteerr11==ppaarraammss,,ffiilltteerr22,,......
              Change video filter chain.

              The first argument decides what happens:

              sseett    Overwrite the previous filter chain with the new one.

              aadddd    Append the new filter chain to the previous one.

              ttooggggllee Check if the given filter (with the exact parameters) is  already  in  the  video
                     chain. If yes, remove the filter. If no, add the filter.  (If several filters are
                     passed to the command, this is done for each filter.)

                     A special variant is combining this with labels, and using @@nnaammee  without  filter
                     name and parameters as filter entry. This toggles the enable/disable flag.

              ddeell    Remove  the  given  filters  from the video chain. Unlike in the other cases, the
                     second parameter is a comma separated list of filter names or integer indexes.  00
                     would  denote  the first filter. Negative indexes start from the last filter, and
                     --11 denotes the last filter.

              ccllrr    Remove all filters. Note that like the other sub-commands, this does not  control
                     automatically inserted filters.

              The argument is always needed. E.g. in case of ccllrr use vvff ccllrr """".

              You can assign labels to filter by prefixing them with @@nnaammee:: (where nnaammee is a user-cho‐
              sen arbitrary identifier). Labels can be used to refer to filters by name in all of  the
              filter  chain  modification commands.  For aadddd, using an already used label will replace
              the existing filter.

              The vvff command shows the list of requested filters on the OSD after changing the  filter
              chain.  This  is  roughly equivalent to sshhooww--tteexxtt $${{vvff}}. Note that auto-inserted filters
              for format conversion are not shown on the list, only what was requested by the user.

              Normally, the commands will check whether the video chain is recreated successfully, and
              will  undo  the  operation  on failure. If the command is run before video is configured
              (can happen if the command is run immediately after opening a file and  before  a  video
              frame  is  decoded), this check can't be run. Then it can happen that creating the video
              chain fails.

                 Example how to toggle disabled filters at runtime

                 · Add something like vvff--aadddd==@@ddeebbaanndd::!!ggrraaddffuunn to mmppvv..ccoonnff.  The @@ddeebbaanndd:: is the label,
                   an  arbitrary,  user-given name for this filter entry. The !! before the filter name
                   disables the filter by default. Everything after this is the normal filter name and
                   possibly filter parameters, like in the normal ----vvff syntax.

                 · Add  aa  vvff  ttooggggllee  @@ddeebbaanndd to iinnppuutt..ccoonnff. This toggles the "disabled" flag for the
                   filter with the label ddeebbaanndd when the aa key is hit.

              Cycle through a list of values. Each invocation of the command will set the given  prop‐
              erty  to the next value in the list. The command will use the current value of the prop‐
              erty/option, and use it to determine the current position in the list of values. Once it
              has  found it, it will set the next value in the list (wrapping around to the first item
              if needed).

              The special argument !!rreevveerrssee can be used to cycle the value list in reverse.  The  only
              advantage is that you don't need to reverse the value list yourself when adding a second
              key binding for cycling backwards.

              Enable all key bindings in the named input section.

              The enabled input sections form a stack. Bindings in sections on the top  of  the  stack
              are  preferred  to lower sections. This command puts the section on top of the stack. If
              the section was already on the stack, it is implicitly removed  beforehand.  (A  section
              cannot be on the stack more than once.)

              The ffllaaggss parameter can be a combination (separated by ++) of the following flags:

              <<eexxcclluussiivvee>>
                     All sections enabled before the newly enabled section are disabled.  They will be
                     re-enabled as soon as all exclusive sections above them  are  removed.  In  other
                     words, the new section shadows all previous sections.

              <<aallllooww--hhiiddee--ccuurrssoorr>>
                     This feature can't be used through the public API.

              <<aallllooww--vvoo--ddrraaggggiinngg>>
                     Same.

       ddiissaabbllee--sseeccttiioonn <<sseeccttiioonn>>
              Disable the named input section. Undoes eennaabbllee--sseeccttiioonn.

       ddeeffiinnee--sseeccttiioonn <<sseeccttiioonn>> <<ccoonntteennttss>> [[ddeeffaauulltt||ffoorrccee]]
              Create  a named input section, or replace the contents of an already existing input sec‐
              tion. The ccoonntteennttss parameter uses the same syntax as the iinnppuutt..ccoonnff  file  (except  that
              using  the section syntax in it is not allowed), including the need to separate bindings
              with a newline character.

              If the ccoonntteennttss parameter is an empty string, the section is removed.

              The section with the name ddeeffaauulltt is the normal input section.

              In general, input sections have to be enabled with the eennaabbllee--sseeccttiioonn command,  or  they
              are ignored.

              The last parameter has the following meaning:

              <<ddeeffaauulltt>> ((aallssoo uusseedd iiff ppaarraammeetteerr oommiitttteedd))
                     Use  a  key binding defined by this section only if the user hasn't already bound
                     this key to a command.

              <<ffoorrccee>>
                     Always bind a key. (The input section that was made active most recently wins  if
                     there are ambiguities.)

              This command can be used to dispatch arbitrary keys to a script or a client API user. If
              the input section defines ssccrriipptt--bbiinnddiinngg commands, it is also possible to  get  separate
              events on key up/down, and relatively detailed information about the key state. The spe‐
              cial key name uunnmmaappppeedd can be used to match any unmapped key.

       oovveerrllaayy--aadddd <<iidd>> <<xx>> <<yy>> <<ffiillee>> <<ooffffsseett>> <<ffmmtt>> <<ww>> <<hh>> <<ssttrriiddee>>
              Add an OSD overlay sourced from raw data. This might be useful for scripts and  applica‐
              tions controlling mpv, and which want to display things on top of the video window.

              Overlays  are  usually displayed in screen resolution, but with some VOs, the resolution
              is reduced to that of the video's. You can read the oossdd--wwiiddtthh and oossdd--hheeiigghhtt properties.
              At  least  with  ----vvoo--xxvv  and  anamorphic video (such as DVD), oossdd--ppaarr should be read as
              well, and the overlay should be aspect-compensated.

              iidd is an integer between 0 and 63 identifying the overlay element. The ID can be used to
              add multiple overlay parts, update a part by using this command with an already existing
              ID, or to remove a part with oovveerrllaayy--rreemmoovvee. Using a previously unused ID will add a new
              overlay, while reusing an ID will update it.

              xx and yy specify the position where the OSD should be displayed.

              ffiillee specifies the file the raw image data is read from. It can be either a numeric UNIX
              file descriptor prefixed with @@ (e.g. @@44), or a filename. The file will be  mapped  into
              memory  with  mmmmaapp(()),  copied,  and  unmapped before the command returns (changed in mpv
              0.18.1).

              It is also possible to pass a raw memory address for use as bitmap memory by  passing  a
              memory  address  as  integer prefixed with an && character.  Passing the wrong thing here
              will crash the player. This mode might be useful for use with libmpv. The ooffffsseett parame‐
              ter is simply added to the memory address (since mpv 0.8.0, ignored before).

              ooffffsseett is the byte offset of the first pixel in the source file.  (The current implemen‐
              tation always mmap's the whole file from position 0 to the end of the  image,  so  large
              offsets  should be avoided. Before mpv 0.8.0, the offset was actually passed directly to
              mmmmaapp, but it was changed to make using it easier.)

              ffmmtt is a string identifying the image format. Currently, only bbggrraa is defined. This for‐
              mat has 4 bytes per pixels, with 8 bits per component.  The least significant 8 bits are
              blue, and the most significant 8 bits are alpha (in little endian,  the  components  are
              B-G-R-A,  with B as first byte). This uses premultiplied alpha: every color component is
              already multiplied with the alpha component. This means the numeric value of each compo‐
              nent  is equal to or smaller than the alpha component. (Violating this rule will lead to
              different results with different VOs: numeric overflows resulting from  blending  broken
              alpha values is considered something that shouldn't happen, and consequently implementa‐
              tions don't ensure that you get predictable behavior in this case.)

              ww, hh, and ssttrriiddee specify the size of the overlay. ww is the visible width of the overlay,
              while  ssttrriiddee  gives the width in bytes in memory. In the simple case, and with the bbggrraa
              format, ssttrriiddee====44**ww.  In general, the total amount of memory accessed  is  ssttrriiddee  **  hh.
              (Technically,  the  minimum  size would be ssttrriiddee ** ((hh -- 11)) ++ ww ** 44, but for simplicity,
              the player will access all ssttrriiddee ** hh bytes.)

              NNOOTTEE::
                 Before mpv 0.18.1, you had to do manual "double buffering" when updating  an  overlay
                 by  replacing it with a different memory buffer. Since mpv 0.18.1, the memory is sim‐
                 ply copied and doesn't reference any of the memory indicated by the  command's  argu‐
                 ments  after the commend returns.  If you want to use this command before mpv 0.18.1,
                 reads the old docs to see how to handle this correctly.

       oovveerrllaayy--rreemmoovvee <<iidd>>
              Remove an overlay added with oovveerrllaayy--aadddd and the same ID. Does  nothing  if  no  overlay
              with this ID exists.

       ssccrriipptt--mmeessssaaggee <<aarrgg11>> <<aarrgg22>> ......
              Send  a  message to all clients, and pass it the following list of arguments.  What this
              message means, how many arguments it takes, and what the arguments mean is fully  up  to
              the receiver and the sender. Every client receives the message, so be careful about name
              clashes (or use ssccrriipptt--mmeessssaaggee--ttoo).

       ssccrriipptt--mmeessssaaggee--ttoo <<ttaarrggeett>> <<aarrgg11>> <<aarrgg22>> ......
              Same as ssccrriipptt--mmeessssaaggee, but send it only to  the  client  named  <<ttaarrggeett>>.  Each  client
              (scripts  etc.)  has  a  unique  name.  For  example, Lua scripts can get their name via
              mmpp..ggeett__ssccrriipptt__nnaammee(()).

       ssccrriipptt--bbiinnddiinngg <<nnaammee>>
              Invoke a script-provided key binding. This can be used to remap key bindings provided by
              external Lua scripts.

              The argument is the name of the binding.

              It  can  optionally  be prefixed with the name of the script, using // as separator, e.g.
              ssccrriipptt--bbiinnddiinngg ssccrriippttnnaammee//bbiinnddiinnggnnaammee.

              For completeness, here is how this command works internally. The  details  could  change
              any  time.  On  any  matching  key  event, ssccrriipptt--mmeessssaaggee--ttoo or ssccrriipptt--mmeessssaaggee is called
              (depending on whether the script name is included), with the following arguments:

              1. The string kkeeyy--bbiinnddiinngg.

              2. The name of the binding (as established above).

              3. The key state as string (see below).

              4. The key name (since mpv 0.15.0).

              The key state consists of 2 letters:

              1. One of dd (key was pressed down), uu (was released), rr (key  is  still  down,  and  was
                 repeated;  only  if key repeat is enabled for this binding), pp (key was pressed; hap‐
                 pens if up/down can't be tracked).

              2. Whether the event originates from the mouse, either mm (mouse button) or --  (something
                 else).

       aabb--lloooopp
              Cycle  through  A-B  loop  states. The first command will set the AA point (the aabb--lloooopp--aa
              property); the second the BB point, and the third will clear both points.

       ddrroopp--bbuuffffeerrss
              Drop audio/video/demuxer buffers, and restart from fresh.  Might  help  with  unseekable
              streams  that  are  going  out of sync.  This command might be changed or removed in the
              future.

       ssccrreeeennsshhoott--rraaww [[ssuubbttiittlleess||vviiddeeoo||wwiinnddooww]]
              Return a screenshot in memory. This can  be  used  only  through  the  client  API.  The
              MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP  returned by this command has the ww, hh, ssttrriiddee fields set to obvious
              contents. The ffoorrmmaatt field is set to bbggrr00  by  default.  This  format  is  organized  as
              BB88GG88RR88XX88  (where  BB  is  the LSB). The contents of the padding XX are undefined. The ddaattaa
              field is of type MPV_FORMAT_BYTE_ARRAY with the actual image data. The image is freed as
              soon  as  the  result mpv_node is freed. As usual with client API semantics, you are not
              allowed to write to the image data.

       vvff--ccoommmmaanndd <<llaabbeell>> <<ccmmdd>> <<aarrggss>>
              Send a command to the filter with the given <<llaabbeell>>. Use aallll to send it to  all  filters
              at  once. The command and argument string is filter specific. Currently, this only works
              with the llaavvffii filter - see the libavfilter documentation for which  commands  a  filter
              supports.

              Note that the <<llaabbeell>> is a mpv filter label, not a libavfilter filter name.

       aaff--ccoommmmaanndd <<llaabbeell>> <<ccmmdd>> <<aarrggss>>
              Same as vvff--ccoommmmaanndd, but for audio filters.

       aappppllyy--pprrooffiillee <<nnaammee>>
              Apply the contents of a named profile. This is like using pprrooffiillee==nnaammee in a config file,
              except you can map it to a key binding to change it at runtime.

              There is no such thing as "unapplying" a profile - applying a profile  merely  sets  all
              option values listed within the profile.

       llooaadd--ssccrriipptt <<ppaatthh>>
              Load a script, similar to the ----ssccrriipptt option. Whether this waits for the script to fin‐
              ish initialization or not changed multiple times, and the future behavior is left  unde‐
              fined.

       cchhaannggee--lliisstt <<ooppttiioonn>> <<ooppeerraattiioonn>> <<vvaalluuee>>
              This  command  changes list options as described in _L_i_s_t _O_p_t_i_o_n_s. The <<ooppttiioonn>> parameter
              is the normal option name, while <<ooppeerraattiioonn>> is the suffix or action used on the option.

              Some operations take no value, but the command still requires the  value  parameter.  In
              these cases, the value must be an empty string.

                 Example

                        cchhaannggee--lliisstt ggllssll--sshhaaddeerrss aappppeenndd ffiillee..ggllssll

                        Add  a  filename  to  the  ggllssll--sshhaaddeerrss  list.  The command line equivalent is
                        ----ggllssll--sshhaaddeerrss--aappppeenndd==ffiillee..ggllssll or alternatively ----ggllssll--sshhaaddeerr==ffiillee..ggllssll.

       Undocumented commands: ttvv--llaasstt--cchhaannnneell (TV/DVB only), aaoo--rreellooaadd (experimental/internal).

       Hooks are synchronous events between player core and a  script  or  similar.  This  applies  to
       client  API  (including the Lua scripting interface). Normally, events are supposed to be asyn‐
       chronous, and the hook API provides an awkward and obscure way to handle  events  that  require
       stricter  coordination.  There are no API stability guarantees made. Not following the protocol
       exactly can make the player freeze randomly. Basically, nobody should use this API.

       The C API is described in the header files. The Lua API is described in the Lua section.

       The following hooks are currently defined:

       oonn__llooaadd
              Called when a file is to be opened, before anything is actually done.  For example,  you
              could  read  and write the ssttrreeaamm--ooppeenn--ffiilleennaammee property to redirect an URL to something
              else (consider support for streaming sites which rarely give the  user  a  direct  media
              URL),   or   you   could   set   per-file   options   with   by   setting  the  property
              ffiillee--llooccaall--ooppttiioonnss//<<ooppttiioonn nnaammee>>. The player will wait until all hooks are run.

       oonn__llooaadd__ffaaiill
              Called after after a file has been opened, but failed to. This can be used to provide  a
              fallback in case native demuxers failed to recognize the file, instead of always running
              before the native demuxers like oonn__llooaadd. Demux will only be retried if ssttrreeaamm--ooppeenn--ffiillee‐‐
              nnaammee was changed.

       oonn__pprreellooaaddeedd
              Called  after  a  file  has been opened, and before tracks are selected and decoders are
              created. This has some usefulness if an API users wants to select tracks manually, based
              on the set of available tracks. It's also useful to initialize ----llaavvffii--ccoommpplleexx in a spe‐
              cific way by API, without having to "probe" the available streams at first.

              Note that this does not yet apply default track selection. Which operations exactly  can
              be done and not be done, and what information is available and what is not yet available
              yet, is all subject to change.

       oonn__uunnllooaadd
              Run before closing a file, and before actually uninitializing everything. It's not  pos‐
              sible to resume playback in this state.

          The legacy API is deprecated and will be removed soon.

       There  are  two  special  commands  involved.  Also, the client must listen for client messages
       (MMPPVV__EEVVEENNTT__CCLLIIEENNTT__MMEESSSSAAGGEE in the C API).

       hhooookk--aadddd <<hhooookk--nnaammee>> <<iidd>> <<pprriioorriittyy>>
              Subscribe to the hook identified by the first argument (basically, the name  of  event).
              The iidd argument is an arbitrary integer chosen by the user. pprriioorriittyy is used to sort all
              hook handlers globally across all clients. Each client can register multiple  hook  han‐
              dlers  (even for the same hook-name). Once the hook is registered, it cannot be unregis‐
              tered.

              When a specific event happens, all registered handlers are run serially.   This  uses  a
              protocol  every  client  has  to follow explicitly. When a hook handler is run, a client
              message (MMPPVV__EEVVEENNTT__CCLLIIEENNTT__MMEESSSSAAGGEE) is sent to the client which registered the hook. This
              message has the following arguments:

              1. the string hhooookk__rruunn

              2. the iidd argument the hook was registered with as string (this can be used to correctly
                 handle multiple hooks registered by the same client, as long as the  iidd  argument  is
                 unique in the client)

              3. something undefined, used by the hook mechanism to track hook execution

              Upon  receiving  this  message,  the  client can handle the event. While doing this, the
              player core will still react to requests, but playback will typically be stopped.

              When the client is done, it must continue the  core's  hook  execution  by  running  the
              hhooookk--aacckk command.

       hhooookk--aacckk <<ssttrriinngg>>
              Run  the next hook in the global chain of hooks. The argument is the 3rd argument of the
              client message that starts hook execution for the current client.

       These prefixes are placed between key name and the actual command.  Multiple  prefixes  can  be
       specified. They are separated by whitespace.

       oossdd--aauuttoo
              Use  the default behavior for this command. This is the default for iinnppuutt..ccoonnff commands.
              Some libmpv/scripting/IPC APIs do not use this as default, but use nnoo--oossdd instead.

       nnoo--oossdd Do not use any OSD for this command.

       oossdd--bbaarr
              If possible, show a bar with this command. Seek commands will  show  the  progress  bar,
              property changing commands may show the newly set value.

       oossdd--mmssgg
              If  possible, show an OSD message with this command. Seek command show the current play‐
              back time, property changing commands show the newly set value as text.

       oossdd--mmssgg--bbaarr
              Combine osd-bar and osd-msg.

       rraaww    Do not expand properties in string arguments. (Like ""$${{pprrooppeerrttyy--nnaammee}}"".)   This  is  the
              default for some libmpv/scripting/IPC APIs.

       eexxppaanndd--pprrooppeerrttiieess
              All  string  arguments  are  expanded  as  described in _P_r_o_p_e_r_t_y _E_x_p_a_n_s_i_o_n.  This is the
              default for iinnppuutt..ccoonnff commands.

       rreeppeeaattaabbllee
              For some commands, keeping a key pressed doesn't run the command repeatedly.  This  pre‐
              fix forces enabling key repeat in any case.

       aassyynncc  Allow  asynchronous  execution (if possible). Note that only a few commands will support
              this (usually this is explicitly documented). Some commands are asynchronous by  default
              (or rather, their effects might manifest after completion of the command). The semantics
              of this flag might change in the future. Set it only if you don't rely on the effects of
              this command being fully realized when it returns.

       All of the osd prefixes are still overridden by the global ----oossdd--lleevveell settings.

   IInnppuutt SSeeccttiioonnss
       Input  sections  group  a  set of bindings, and enable or disable them at once.  In iinnppuutt..ccoonnff,
       each key binding is assigned to an input section, rather than  actually  having  explicit  text
       sections.

       See also: eennaabbllee--sseeccttiioonn and ddiissaabbllee--sseeccttiioonn commands.

       Predefined bindings:

       ddeeffaauulltt
              Bindings without input section are implicitly assigned to this section. It is enabled by
              default during normal playback.

       eennccooddee Section which is active in encoding mode. It is enabled exclusively, so that bindings in
              the ddeeffaauulltt sections are ignored.

   PPrrooppeerrttiieess
       Properties  are used to set mpv options during runtime, or to query arbitrary information. They
       can be manipulated with the sseett/aadddd/ccyyccllee commands, and retrieved with sshhooww--tteexxtt,  or  anything
       else that uses property expansion. (See _P_r_o_p_e_r_t_y _E_x_p_a_n_s_i_o_n.)

       The property name is annotated with RW to indicate whether the property is generally writable.

       If  an  option is referenced, the property will normally take/return exactly the same values as
       the option. In these cases, properties are merely a way to change an option at runtime.

   PPrrooppeerrttyy lliisstt
       NNOOTTEE::
          Most options can be set as runtime via properties as well. Just remove the leading  ----  from
          the option name. These are not documented. Only properties which do not exist as option with
          the same name, or which have very different behavior from the options are documented below.

       aauuddiioo--ssppeeeedd--ccoorrrreeccttiioonn,, vviiddeeoo--ssppeeeedd--ccoorrrreeccttiioonn
              Factor multiplied with ssppeeeedd at which the player attempts to play the file. Usually it's
              exactly 1. (Display sync mode will make this useful.)

              OSD formatting will display it in the form of ++11..2233445566%%, with the number being ((rraaww -- 11))
              ** 110000 for the given raw property value.

       ddiissppllaayy--ssyynncc--aaccttiivvee
              Return whether ----vviiddeeoo--ssyynncc==ddiissppllaayy is actually active.

       ffiilleennaammee
              Currently played file, with path stripped. If this is an URL, try to undo percent encod‐
              ing  as  well. (The result is not necessarily correct, but looks better for display pur‐
              poses. Use the ppaatthh property to get an unmodified filename.)

              This has a sub-property:

              ffiilleennaammee//nnoo--eexxtt
                     Like the ffiilleennaammee property, but if the text contains a .., strip  all  text  after
                     the last ... Usually this removes the file extension.

       ffiillee--ssiizzee
              Length  in bytes of the source file/stream. (This is the same as $${{ssttrreeaamm--eenndd}}. For seg‐
              mented/multi-part files, this will return the size of the main or manifest  file,  what‐
              ever it is.)

       eessttiimmaatteedd--ffrraammee--ccoouunntt
              Total number of frames in current file.

              NNOOTTEE::
                 This  is  only  an  estimate.  (It's computed from two unreliable quantities: fps and
                 stream length.)

       eessttiimmaatteedd--ffrraammee--nnuummbbeerr
              Number of current frame in current stream.

              NNOOTTEE::
                 This is only an estimate. (It's computed from two unreliable quantities: fps and pos‐
                 sibly rounded timestamps.)

       ppaatthh   Full path of the currently played file. Usually this is exactly the same string you pass
              on the mpv command line or the llooaaddffiillee command, even if it's a relative  path.  If  you
              expect  an  absolute  path, you will have to determine it yourself, for example by using
              the wwoorrkkiinngg--ddiirreeccttoorryy property.

       mmeeddiiaa--ttiittllee
              If the currently played file has a ttiittllee tag, use that.

              Otherwise, if the media type is DVD, return the volume ID of DVD.

              Otherwise, return the ffiilleennaammee property.

       ffiillee--ffoorrmmaatt
              Symbolic name of the file format. In some cases, this is a comma-separated list of  for‐
              mat  names, e.g. mp4 is mmoovv,,mmpp44,,mm44aa,,33ggpp,,33gg22,,mmjj22 (the list may grow in the future for any
              format).

       ccuurrrreenntt--ddeemmuuxxeerr
              Name of the current demuxer. (This is useless.)

              (Renamed from ddeemmuuxxeerr.)

       ssttrreeaamm--ppaatthh
              Filename (full path) of the stream layer filename. (This  is  probably  useless  and  is
              almost never different from ppaatthh.)

       ssttrreeaamm--ppooss
              Raw  byte  position in source stream. Technically, this returns the position of the most
              recent packet passed to a decoder.

       ssttrreeaamm--eenndd
              Raw end position in bytes in source stream.

       dduurraattiioonn
              Duration of the current file in seconds. If the duration is  unknown,  the  property  is
              unavailable.  Note  that  the  file  duration is not always exactly known, so this is an
              estimate.

              This replaces the lleennggtthh property, which was deprecated after the mpv 0.9 release.  (The
              semantics are the same.)

       aavvssyynncc Last A/V synchronization difference. Unavailable if audio or video is disabled.

       ttoottaall--aavvssyynncc--cchhaannggee
              Total A-V sync correction done. Unavailable if audio or video is disabled.

       ddeeccooddeerr--ffrraammee--ddrroopp--ccoouunntt
              Video  frames  dropped  by  decoder,  because  video is too far behind audio (when using
              ----ffrraammeeddrroopp==ddeeccooddeerr). Sometimes, this may be incremented in other situations, e.g.  when
              video packets are damaged, or the decoder doesn't follow the usual rules. Unavailable if
              video is disabled.

              ddrroopp--ffrraammee--ccoouunntt is a deprecated alias.

       ffrraammee--ddrroopp--ccoouunntt
              Frames dropped by VO (when using ----ffrraammeeddrroopp==vvoo).

              vvoo--ddrroopp--ffrraammee--ccoouunntt is a deprecated alias.

       mmiissttiimmeedd--ffrraammee--ccoouunntt
              Number of video frames that were not timed correctly in display-sync mode for  the  sake
              of keeping A/V sync. This does not include external circumstances, such as video render‐
              ing being too slow or the graphics driver somehow skipping a vsync. It does not  include
              rounding  errors  either  (which  can happen especially with bad source timestamps). For
              example, using the ddiissppllaayy--ddeessyynncc mode should never change this value from 0.

       vvssyynncc--rraattiioo
              For how many vsyncs a frame is displayed on average. This is available  if  display-sync
              is  active  only. For 30 FPS video on a 60 Hz screen, this will be 2. This is the moving
              average of what actually has been scheduled, so 24  FPS  on  60  Hz  will  never  remain
              exactly on 2.5, but jitter depending on the last frame displayed.

       vvoo--ddeellaayyeedd--ffrraammee--ccoouunntt
              Estimated  number  of frames delayed due to external circumstances in display-sync mode.
              Note that in general, mpv has to guess that this is happening,  and  the  guess  can  be
              inaccurate.

       ppeerrcceenntt--ppooss ((RRWW))
              Position  in  current file (0-100). The advantage over using this instead of calculating
              it out of other properties is that it properly falls back  to  estimating  the  playback
              position from the byte position, if the file duration is not known.

       ttiimmee--ppooss ((RRWW))
              Position in current file in seconds.

       ttiimmee--ssttaarrtt
              Deprecated. Always returns 0. Before mpv 0.14, this used to return the start time of the
              file (could affect e.g. transport streams). See ----rreebbaassee--ssttaarrtt--ttiimmee option.

       ttiimmee--rreemmaaiinniinngg
              Remaining length of the file in seconds. Note that  the  file  duration  is  not  always
              exactly known, so this is an estimate.

       aauuddiioo--ppttss ((RR))
              Current  audio  playback  position  in  current  file  in seconds. Unlike time-pos, this
              updates more often than once per frame. For audio-only files, it is mostly equivalent to
              time-pos, while for video-only files this property is not available.

       ppllaayyttiimmee--rreemmaaiinniinngg
              ttiimmee--rreemmaaiinniinngg scaled by the current ssppeeeedd.

       ppllaayybbaacckk--ttiimmee ((RRWW))
              Position  in  current file in seconds. Unlike ttiimmee--ppooss, the time is clamped to the range
              of the file. (Inaccurate file durations etc. could make it go out of  range.  Useful  on
              attempts  to seek outside of the file, as the seek target time is considered the current
              position during seeking.)

       cchhaapptteerr ((RRWW))
              Current chapter number. The number of the first chapter is 0.

       eeddiittiioonn ((RRWW))
              Current MKV edition number. Setting this property to  a  different  value  will  restart
              playback. The number of the first edition is 0.

       ddiisscc--ttiittlleess
              Number of BD/DVD titles.

              This has a number of sub-properties. Replace NN with the 0-based edition index.

              ddiisscc--ttiittlleess//ccoouunntt
                     Number of titles.

              ddiisscc--ttiittlleess//iidd
                     Title ID as integer. Currently, this is the same as the title index.

              ddiisscc--ttiittlleess//lleennggtthh
                     Length  in  seconds.  Can be unavailable in a number of cases (currently it works
                     for libdvdnav only).

              When querying the property with the  client  API  using  MMPPVV__FFOORRMMAATT__NNOODDEE,  or  with  Lua

       ddiisscc--ttiittllee--lliisstt

       eeddiittiioonnss
              Number of MKV editions.

       eeddiittiioonn--lliisstt
              List of editions, current entry marked. Currently, the raw property value is useless.

              This has a number of sub-properties. Replace NN with the 0-based edition index.

              eeddiittiioonn--lliisstt//ccoouunntt
                     Number of editions. If there are no editions, this can be 0 or 1 (1 if there's  a
                     useless dummy edition).

              eeddiittiioonn--lliisstt//NN//iidd
                     Edition  ID as integer. Use this to set the eeddiittiioonn property.  Currently, this is
                     the same as the edition index.

              eeddiittiioonn--lliisstt//NN//ddeeffaauulltt
                     yyeess if this is the default edition, nnoo otherwise.

              eeddiittiioonn--lliisstt//NN//ttiittllee
                     Edition title as stored in the file. Not always available.

              When querying the property with the  client  API  using  MMPPVV__FFOORRMMAATT__NNOODDEE,  or  with  Lua
              mmpp..ggeett__pprrooppeerrttyy__nnaattiivvee, this will return a mpv_node with the following contents:

                 MPV_FORMAT_NODE_ARRAY
                     MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP (for each edition)
                         "id"                MPV_FORMAT_INT64
                         "title"             MPV_FORMAT_STRING
                         "default"           MPV_FORMAT_FLAG

       aannggllee ((RRWW))
              Current DVD angle.

       mmeettaaddaattaa
              Metadata key/value pairs.

              If the property is accessed with Lua's mmpp..ggeett__pprrooppeerrttyy__nnaattiivvee, this returns a table with
              metadata keys mapping to metadata values. If it is accessed with the  client  API,  this
              returns a MMPPVV__FFOORRMMAATT__NNOODDEE__MMAAPP, with tag keys mapping to tag values.

              For  OSD,  it returns a formatted list. Trying to retrieve this property as a raw string
              doesn't work.

              This has a number of sub-properties:

              mmeettaaddaattaa//bbyy--kkeeyy//<<kkeeyy>>
                     Value of metadata entry <<kkeeyy>>.

              mmeettaaddaattaa//lliisstt//ccoouunntt
                     Number of metadata entries.

              mmeettaaddaattaa//lliisstt//NN//kkeeyy
                     Key name of the Nth metadata entry. (The first entry is 00).

              mmeettaaddaattaa//lliisstt//NN//vvaalluuee
                     Value of the Nth metadata entry.

              mmeettaaddaattaa//<<kkeeyy>>
                     Old version of mmeettaaddaattaa//bbyy--kkeeyy//<<kkeeyy>>. Use is discouraged,  because  the  metadata
                     key string could conflict with other sub-properties.

              The  layout  of  this  property  might be subject to change. Suggestions are welcome how
              exactly this property should work.

              When querying the property with the  client  API  using  MMPPVV__FFOORRMMAATT__NNOODDEE,  or  with  Lua
              mmpp..ggeett__pprrooppeerrttyy__nnaattiivvee, this will return a mpv_node with the following contents:

                 MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP
                     (key and string value for each metadata entry)

       ffiilltteerreedd--mmeettaaddaattaa
              Like mmeettaaddaattaa, but includes only fields listed in the ----ddiissppllaayy--ttaaggss option. This is the
              same set of tags that is printed to the terminal.

       cchhaapptteerr--mmeettaaddaattaa
              Metadata of current chapter. Works similar to mmeettaaddaattaa property. It also allows the same
              access methods (using sub-properties).

              Per-chapter metadata is very rare. Usually, only the chapter name (ttiittllee) is set.

              For accessing other information, like chapter start, see the cchhaapptteerr--lliisstt property.

       vvff--mmeettaaddaattaa//<<ffiilltteerr--llaabbeell>>
              Metadata  added by video filters. Accessed by the filter label, which, if not explicitly
              specified using the @@ffiilltteerr--llaabbeell:: syntax, will be <<ffiilltteerr--nnaammee>>NNNN.

              Works similar to mmeettaaddaattaa property. It allows the same access methods (using sub-proper‐
              ties).

              An   example   of   this   kind  of  metadata  are  the  cropping  parameters  added  by
              ----vvff==llaavvffii==ccrrooppddeetteecctt.

       aaff--mmeettaaddaattaa//<<ffiilltteerr--llaabbeell>>
              Equivalent to vvff--mmeettaaddaattaa//<<ffiilltteerr--llaabbeell>>, but for audio filters.

       iiddllee--aaccttiivvee
              Return yyeess if no file is loaded, but the player is staying around because of the  ----iiddllee
              option.

              (Renamed from iiddllee.)

       ccoorree--iiddllee
              Return  yyeess if the playback core is paused, otherwise nnoo. This can be different ppaauussee in
              special situations, such as when the player pauses itself due to low network cache.

              This also returns yyeess if playback is restarting or if nothing  is  playing  at  all.  In
              other words, it's only nnoo if there's actually video playing. (Behavior since mpv 0.7.0.)

       ccaacchhee  Network cache fill state (0-100.0).

       ccaacchhee--ssiizzee ((RRWW))
              Network cache size in KB. This is similar to ----ccaacchhee. This allows setting the cache size
              at runtime. Currently, it's not possible to enable or disable the cache at runtime using
              this property, just to resize an existing cache.

              This does not include the backbuffer size (changed after mpv 0.10.0).

              Note that this tries to keep the cache contents as far as possible. To make this easier,
              the cache resizing code will allocate the new cache while the old cache is  still  allo‐
              cated.

              Don't use this when playing DVD or Blu-ray.

       ccaacchhee--ffrreeee ((RR))
              Total free cache size in KB.

       ccaacchhee--uusseedd ((RR))
              Total used cache size in KB.

       ccaacchhee--ssppeeeedd ((RR))
              Current I/O read speed between the cache and the lower layer (like network).  This gives
              the number bytes per seconds over a 1 second window (using the type MMPPVV__FFOORRMMAATT__IINNTT6644 for
              the client API).

       ccaacchhee--iiddllee ((RR))
              Returns  yyeess  if the cache is idle, which means the cache is filled as much as possible,
              and is currently not reading more data.

       ddeemmuuxxeerr--ccaacchhee--dduurraattiioonn
              Approximate duration of video buffered in the demuxer, in seconds.  The  guess  is  very
              unreliable,  and  often  the  property  will  not  be  available at all, even if data is
              buffered.

       ddeemmuuxxeerr--ccaacchhee--ttiimmee
              Approximate  time  of  video  buffered   in   the   demuxer,   in   seconds.   Same   as
              ddeemmuuxxeerr--ccaacchhee--dduurraattiioonn but returns the last timestamp of buffered data in demuxer.

       ddeemmuuxxeerr--ccaacchhee--iiddllee
              Returns  yyeess  if  the  demuxer  is  idle, which means the demuxer cache is filled to the
              requested amount, and is currently not reading more data.

       ddeemmuuxxeerr--ccaacchhee--ssttaattee
              Various undocumented or half-documented things.

              Each entry in sseeeekkaabbllee--rraannggeess represents a region in  the  demuxer  cache  that  can  be
              seeked  to.  If  there are multiple demuxers active, this only returns information about
              the "main" demuxer, but might be changed in future to return unified  information  about
              all  demuxers.  The ranges are in arbitrary order. Often, ranges will overlap for a bit,
              before being joined.  In broken corner cases, ranges may overlap all over the place.

              The  end  of  a  seek  range  is  usually  smaller  than  the  value  returned  by   the
              ddeemmuuxxeerr--ccaacchhee--ttiimmee property, because that property returns the guessed buffering amount,
              while the seek ranges represent the buffered data that can actually be used  for  cached
              seeking.

              ffww--bbyytteess  is the number of bytes of packets buffered in the range starting from the cur‐
              rent decoding position.

              When querying the property with the  client  API  using  MMPPVV__FFOORRMMAATT__NNOODDEE,  or  with  Lua
              mmpp..ggeett__pprrooppeerrttyy__nnaattiivvee, this will return a mpv_node with the following contents:

                 MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP
                     "seekable-ranges"   MPV_FORMAT_NODE_ARRAY
                         MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP
                             "start"             MPV_FORMAT_DOUBLE
                             "end"               MPV_FORMAT_DOUBLE
                     "fw-bytes"          MPV_FORMAT_INT64

              Other fields (might be changed or removed in the future):

              eeooff    True if the reader thread has hit the end of the file.

              uunnddeerrrruunn
                     True if the reader thread could not satisfy a decoder's request for a new packet.

              iiddllee   True if the thread is currently not reading.

              ttoottaall--bbyytteess
                     Sum  of  packet bytes (plus some overhead estimation) of the entire packet queue,
                     including cached seekable ranges.

              ffww--bbyytteess
                     Sum of packet bytes (plus some overhead estimation) of the readahead packet queue
                     (packets between current decoder reader positions and demuxer position).

       ddeemmuuxxeerr--vviiaa--nneettwwoorrkk
              Returns  yyeess  if  the stream demuxed via the main demuxer is most likely played via net‐
              work. What constitutes "network" is not always clear, might be used for other  types  of
              untrusted  streams,  could be wrong in certain cases, and its definition might be chang‐
              ing. Also, external files (like separate audio files or streams) do  not  influence  the
              value of this property (currently).

       ddeemmuuxxeerr--ssttaarrtt--ttiimmee ((RR))
              Returns the start time reported by the demuxer in fractional seconds.

       ppaauusseedd--ffoorr--ccaacchhee
              Returns yyeess when playback is paused because of waiting for the cache.

       ccaacchhee--bbuuffffeerriinngg--ssttaattee
              Return  the  percentage  (0-100)  of the cache fill status until the player will unpause
              (related to ppaauusseedd--ffoorr--ccaacchhee).

       eeooff--rreeaacchheedd
              Returns yyeess if end of playback was reached, nnoo otherwise.  Note  that  this  is  usually
              interesting  only if ----kkeeeepp--ooppeenn is enabled, since otherwise the player will immediately
              play the next file (or exit or enter idle mode), and  in  these  cases  the  eeooff--rreeaacchheedd
              property will logically be cleared immediately after it's set.

       sseeeekkiinngg
              Returns yyeess if the player is currently seeking, or otherwise trying to restart playback.
              (It's possible that it returns yyeess while a file is loadedThis is because the same under‐
              lying code is used for seeking and resyncing.)

       mmiixxeerr--aaccttiivvee
              Return yyeess if the audio mixer is active, nnoo otherwise.

              This option is relatively useless. Before mpv 0.18.1, it could be used to infer behavior
              of the vvoolluummee property.

       aaoo--vvoolluummee ((RRWW))
              System volume. This property is available only if mpv audio output is currently  active,
              and only if the underlying implementation supports volume control. What this option does
              depends on the API. For example, on ALSA this usually changes system-wide  audio,  while
              with PulseAudio this controls per-application volume.

       aaoo--mmuuttee ((RRWW))
              Similar  to aaoo--vvoolluummee, but controls the mute state. May be unimplemented even if aaoo--vvooll‐‐
              uummee works.

       aauuddiioo--ccooddeecc
              Audio codec selected for decoding.

       aauuddiioo--ccooddeecc--nnaammee
              Audio codec.

       aauuddiioo--ppaarraammss
              Audio format as output by the audio decoder.  This has a number of sub-properties:

              aauuddiioo--ppaarraammss//ffoorrmmaatt
                     The sample format as string. This uses the same names as used in other places  of
                     mpv.

              aauuddiioo--ppaarraammss//ssaammpplleerraattee
                     Samplerate.

              aauuddiioo--ppaarraammss//cchhaannnneellss
                     The  channel  layout  as  a  string. This is similar to what the ----aauuddiioo--cchhaannnneellss
                     accepts.

              aauuddiioo--ppaarraammss//hhrr--cchhaannnneellss
                     As cchhaannnneellss, but instead of the possibly cryptic actual layout sent to the  audio
                     device,   return   a   hopefully   more   human  readable  form.   (Usually  only
                     aauuddiioo--oouutt--ppaarraammss//hhrr--cchhaannnneellss makes sense.)

                     Number of audio channels. This is  redundant  to  the  cchhaannnneellss  field  described
                     above.

              When  querying  the  property  with  the  client  API using MMPPVV__FFOORRMMAATT__NNOODDEE, or with Lua
              mmpp..ggeett__pprrooppeerrttyy__nnaattiivvee, this will return a mpv_node with the following contents:

                 MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP
                     "format"            MPV_FORMAT_STRING

                     "channel-count"     MPV_FORMAT_INT64
                     "hr-channels"       MPV_FORMAT_STRING

       aauuddiioo--oouutt--ppaarraammss
              Same as aauuddiioo--ppaarraammss, but the format of the data written to the audio API.

       ccoolloorrmmaattrriixx ((RR))
              Redirects to vviiddeeoo--ppaarraammss//ccoolloorrmmaattrriixx. This parameter (as well as similar ones)  can  be
              overridden with the ffoorrmmaatt video filter.

       hhwwddeecc ((RRWW))
              Reflects the ----hhwwddeecc option.

              Writing to it may change the currently used hardware decoder, if possible.  (Internally,
              the player may reinitialize the decoder, and will perform a seek to  refresh  the  video
              properly.) You can watch the other hwdec properties to see whether this was successful.

              Unlike  in  mpv  0.9.x  and  before,  this does not return the currently active hardware
              decoder. Since mpv 0.18.0, hhwwddeecc--ccuurrrreenntt is available for this purpose.

       hhwwddeecc--ccuurrrreenntt
              Return the current hardware decoding in use. If decoding is active, return  one  of  the
              values  used by the hhwwddeecc option/property. nnoo indicates software decoding. If no decoder
              is loaded, the property is unavailable.

       hhwwddeecc--iinntteerroopp
              This returns the currently loaded hardware  decoding/output  interop  driver.   This  is
              known  only  once the VO has opened (and possibly later). With some VOs (like ggppuu), this
              might be never known in advance, but only when the decoder attempted to  create  the  hw
              decoder successfully. (Using ----ggppuu--hhwwddeecc--iinntteerroopp can load it eagerly.) If there are mul‐
              tiple drivers loaded, they will be separated by ,,.

              If no VO is active or no interop driver is known, this property is unavailable.

              This does not necessarily use the same values as hhwwddeecc. There can  be  multiple  interop
              drivers for the same hardware decoder, depending on platform and VO.

       vviiddeeoo--ffoorrmmaatt
              Video format as string.

       vviiddeeoo--ccooddeecc
              Video codec selected for decoding.

       wwiiddtthh,, hheeiigghhtt
              Video  size.  This  uses the size of the video as decoded, or if no video frame has been
              decoded yet, the (possibly incorrect) container indicated size.

       vviiddeeoo--ppaarraammss
              Video parameters, as output by the decoder (with overrides like  aspect  etc.  applied).
              This has a number of sub-properties:

              vviiddeeoo--ppaarraammss//ppiixxeellffoorrmmaatt
                     The  pixel  format as string. This uses the same names as used in other places of
                     mpv.

              vviiddeeoo--ppaarraammss//aavveerraaggee--bbpppp
                     Average bits-per-pixel as integer. Subsampled planar formats use a different res‐
                     olution, which is the reason this value can sometimes be odd or confusing. Can be
                     unavailable with some formats.

              vviiddeeoo--ppaarraammss//ppllaannee--ddeepptthh
                     Bit depth for each color component as integer. This is only exposed for planar or
                     single-component formats, and is unavailable for other formats.

              vviiddeeoo--ppaarraammss//ww,, vviiddeeoo--ppaarraammss//hh
                     Video size as integers, with no aspect correction applied.

              vviiddeeoo--ppaarraammss//ddww,, vviiddeeoo--ppaarraammss//ddhh
                     Video size as integers, scaled for correct aspect ratio.

              vviiddeeoo--ppaarraammss//aassppeecctt
                     Display aspect ratio as float.

              vviiddeeoo--ppaarraammss//ppaarr
                     Pixel aspect ratio.

                     The colorlevels as string. (Exact values subject to change.)

              vviiddeeoo--ppaarraammss//pprriimmaarriieess
                     The primaries in use as string. (Exact values subject to change.)

              vviiddeeoo--ppaarraammss//ggaammmmaa
                     The gamma function in use as string. (Exact values subject to change.)

              vviiddeeoo--ppaarraammss//ssiigg--ppeeaakk
                     The video file's tagged signal peak as float.

              vviiddeeoo--ppaarraammss//lliigghhtt
                     The light type in use as a string. (Exact values subject to change.)

                     Chroma location as string. (Exact values subject to change.)

              vviiddeeoo--ppaarraammss//rroottaattee
                     Intended display rotation in degrees (clockwise).

              vviiddeeoo--ppaarraammss//sstteerreeoo--iinn
                     Source file stereo 3D mode. (See ----vviiddeeoo--sstteerreeoo--mmooddee option.)

              When  querying  the  property  with  the  client  API using MMPPVV__FFOORRMMAATT__NNOODDEE, or with Lua

       ddwwiiddtthh,, ddhheeiigghhtt
              Video display size. This is the video size after filters and aspect  scaling  have  been
              applied. The actual video window size can still be different from this, e.g. if the user
              resized the video window manually.

              These have the same values as vviiddeeoo--oouutt--ppaarraammss//ddww and vviiddeeoo--oouutt--ppaarraammss//ddhh.

       vviiddeeoo--ddeecc--ppaarraammss
              Exactly like vviiddeeoo--ppaarraammss, but no overrides applied.

       vviiddeeoo--oouutt--ppaarraammss
              Same as vviiddeeoo--ppaarraammss, but after video filters have been applied. If there are  no  video
              filters  in  use,  this  will contain the same values as vviiddeeoo--ppaarraammss. Note that this is
              still not necessarily what the video window uses, since the user can change  the  window
              size, and all real VOs do their own scaling independently from the filter chain.

              Has the same sub-properties as vviiddeeoo--ppaarraammss.

       vviiddeeoo--ffrraammee--iinnffoo
              Approximate information of the current frame. Note that if any of these are used on OSD,
              the information might be off by a few frames due to  OSD  redrawing  and  frame  display
              being somewhat disconnected, and you might have to pause and force a redraw.

              Sub-properties:

                 video-frame-info/picture-type
                 video-frame-info/interlaced
                 video-frame-info/tff
                 video-frame-info/repeat

       ccoonnttaaiinneerr--ffppss
              Container  FPS.  This  can  easily contain bogus values. For videos that use modern con‐
              tainer formats or video codecs, this will often be incorrect.

              (Renamed from ffppss.)

       eessttiimmaatteedd--vvff--ffppss
              Estimated/measured FPS of the video filter chain output. (If no filters are  used,  this
              corresponds  to decoder output.) This uses the average of the 10 past frame durations to
              calculate the FPS. It will be inaccurate if frame-dropping is  involved  (such  as  when
              framedrop  is  explicitly enabled, or after precise seeking). Files with imprecise time‐
              stamps (such as Matroska) might lead to unstable results.

       wwiinnddooww--ssccaallee ((RRWW))
              Window size multiplier. Setting this will resize the video window  to  the  values  con‐
              tained in ddwwiiddtthh and ddhheeiigghhtt multiplied with the value set with this property. Setting 11
              will resize to original video size (or to be exact, the size the video filters  output).
              22 will set the double size, 00..55 halves the size.

       wwiinnddooww--mmiinniimmiizzeedd
              Return whether the video window is minimized or not.

       ddiissppllaayy--nnaammeess
              Names  of  the  displays  that the mpv window covers. On X11, these are the xrandr names
              (LVDS1, HDMI1, DP1, VGA1, etc.). On Windows, these are the GDI names (\.DISPLAY1, \.DIS‐
              PLAY2,  etc.)  and  the first display in the list will be the one that Windows considers
              associated with the window (as determined by the MonitorFromWindow API.)

       ddiissppllaayy--ffppss ((RRWW))
              The refresh rate of the current display. Currently, this is the lowest FPS of  any  dis‐
              play  covered  by  the video, as retrieved by the underlying system APIs (e.g. xrandr on
              X11). It is not the measured FPS. It's not necessarily available on all platforms.  Note
              that any of the listed facts may change any time without a warning.

       eessttiimmaatteedd--ddiissppllaayy--ffppss
              Only available if display-sync mode (as selected by ----vviiddeeoo--ssyynncc) is active. Returns the
              actual rate at which display refreshes seem to occur, measured by system time.

       vvssyynncc--jjiitttteerr
              Estimated deviation factor of the vsync duration.

       vviiddeeoo--aassppeecctt ((RRWW))
              Video aspect, see ----vviiddeeoo--aassppeecctt.

              If video is active, this reports the effective aspect value, instead of the value of the
              ----vviiddeeoo--aassppeecctt option.

       oossdd--wwiiddtthh,, oossdd--hheeiigghhtt
              Last  known OSD width (can be 0). This is needed if you want to use the oovveerrllaayy--aadddd com‐
              mand. It gives you the actual OSD size, which can be different from the window  size  in
              some cases.

       oossdd--ppaarr
              Last known OSD display pixel aspect (can be 0).

       pprrooggrraamm ((WW))
              Switch TS program (write-only).

       ddvvbb--cchhaannnneell ((WW))
              Pair  of  integers:  card,channel  of  current DVB stream.  Can be switched to switch to
              another channel on the same card.

       ddvvbb--cchhaannnneell--nnaammee ((RRWW))
              Name of current DVB program.  On write, a channel-switch to the  named  channel  on  the
              same card is performed. Can also be used for channel switching.

       ssuubb--tteexxtt
              Return the current subtitle text. Formatting is stripped. If a subtitle is selected, but
              no text is currently visible, or the subtitle is not text-based (i.e. DVD/BD subtitles),
              an empty string is returned.

              This property is experimental and might be removed in the future.

       ttvv--bbrriigghhttnneessss,, ttvv--ccoonnttrraasstt,, ttvv--ssaattuurraattiioonn,, ttvv--hhuuee ((RRWW))
              TV stuff.

       ppllaayylliisstt--ppooss ((RRWW))
              Current  position on playlist. The first entry is on position 0. Writing to the property
              will restart playback at the written entry.

       ppllaayylliisstt--ppooss--11 ((RRWW))
              Same as ppllaayylliisstt--ppooss, but 1-based.

       ppllaayylliisstt--ccoouunntt
              Number of total playlist entries.

       ppllaayylliisstt
              Playlist, current entry marked. Currently, the raw property value is useless.

              This has a number of sub-properties. Replace NN with the 0-based playlist entry index.

                     currently playing file hasn't been unloaded yet; in this case, ccuurrrreenntt refers  to
                     the new selection. (Since mpv 0.7.0.)

                     The  stream  index as usually used by the FFmpeg utilities. Note that this can be

                     For mkv files, the index will usually match even if the default (builtin) demuxer
                     is used, but there is no hard guarantee.

              It's also possible to write the property using this format.

       sseeeekkaabbllee
              Return whether it's generally possible to seek in the current file.

       ppaarrttiiaallllyy--sseeeekkaabbllee
              Return yyeess if the current file is considered seekable, but only  because  the  cache  is
              active.  This  means small relative seeks may be fine, but larger seeks may fail anyway.
              Whether a seek will succeed or not is generally not known in advance.

              If this property returns true, sseeeekkaabbllee will also return true.

       ppllaayybbaacckk--aabboorrtt
              Return whether playback is stopped or is to be stopped. (Useful  in  obscure  situations
              like during oonn__llooaadd hook processing, when the user can stop playback, but the script has
              to explicitly end processing.)

       ccuurrssoorr--aauuttoohhiiddee ((RRWW))
              See ----ccuurrssoorr--aauuttoohhiiddee. Setting this to a new value will always update  the  cursor,  and
              reset the internal timer.

       oossdd--ssyymm--cccc
              Inserts  the  current  OSD symbol as opaque OSD control code (cc). This makes sense only
              with the sshhooww--tteexxtt command or options which set  OSD  messages.   The  control  code  is
              implementation specific and is useless for anything else.

       oossdd--aassss--cccc
              $${{oossdd--aassss--cccc//00}}  disables escaping ASS sequences of text in OSD, $${{oossdd--aassss--cccc//11}} enables
              it again. By default, ASS sequences are escaped to avoid accidental formatting, and this
              property  can  disable this behavior. Note that the properties return an opaque OSD con‐
              trol code, which only makes sense for the sshhooww--tteexxtt command or  options  which  set  OSD

              Any ASS override tags as understood by libass can be used.

              Note  that  you  need  to  escape the \\ character, because the string is processed for C
              escape sequences before passing it to the OSD code.

       vvoo--ccoonnffiigguurreedd
              Return whether the VO is configured right now. Usually this corresponds to  whether  the
              video  window  is  visible. If the ----ffoorrccee--wwiinnddooww option is used, this is usually always
              returns yyeess.

       vvoo--ppaasssseess
              Contains introspection about the VO's active render passes and  their  execution  times.
              Not implemented by all VOs.

              This is further subdivided into two frame types, vvoo--ppaasssseess//ffrreesshh for fresh frames (which
              have to be uploaded, scaled, etc.) and vvoo--ppaasssseess//rreeddrraaww for redrawn frames  (which  only
              have  to  be  re-painted).   The  number of passes for any given subtype can change from
              frame to frame, and should not be relied upon.

              Each frame type has a number of further sub-properties.  Replace  TTYYPPEE  with  the  frame
              type, NN with the 0-based pass index, and MM with the 0-based sample index.

              vvoo--ppaasssseess//TTYYPPEE//ccoouunntt

              vvoo--ppaasssseess//TTYYPPEE//NN//aavvgg
                     Average  execution time of this pass, in nanoseconds. The exact timeframe varies,
                     but it should generally be a handful of seconds.

                     onds.

              When  querying  the  property  with  the  client  API using MMPPVV__FFOORRMMAATT__NNOODDEE, or with Lua
              mmpp..ggeett__pprrooppeerrttyy__nnaattiivvee, this will return a mpv_node with the following contents:

                 MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP
                 "TYPE" MPV_FORMAT_NODE_ARRAY
                     MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP
                         "desc"    MPV_FORMAT_STRING
                         "last"    MPV_FORMAT_INT64

                              MP_FORMAT_INT64

              Note that directly accessing this structure via  subkeys  is  not  supported,  the  only
              access is through aforementioned MMPPVV__FFOORRMMAATT__NNOODDEE.

       vviiddeeoo--bbiittrraattee,, aauuddiioo--bbiittrraattee,, ssuubb--bbiittrraattee
              Bitrate  values  calculated  on the packet level. This works by dividing the bit size of
              all packets between two keyframes by their presentation timestamp distance.  (This  uses
              the  timestamps  are  stored  in the file, so e.g. playback speed does not influence the
              returned values.) In particular, the video bitrate will update only  per  keyframe,  and
              show the "past" bitrate. To make the property more UI friendly, updates to these proper‐
              ties are throttled in a certain way.

              The unit is bits per second. OSD formatting turns these values in kilobits (or megabits,
              if  appropriate),  which  can  be  prevented  by using the raw property value, e.g. with
              $${{==vviiddeeoo--bbiittrraattee}}.

              Note that the accuracy of these properties is influenced  by  a  few  factors.   If  the
              underlying  demuxer  rewrites  the packets on demuxing (done for some file formats), the
              bitrate might be slightly off. If timestamps are bad or jittery (like in Matroska), even
              constant bitrate streams might show fluctuating bitrate.

              How exactly these values are calculated might change in the future.

              In  earlier  versions of mpv, these properties returned a static (but bad) guess using a
              completely different method.

       ppaacckkeett--vviiddeeoo--bbiittrraattee,, ppaacckkeett--aauuddiioo--bbiittrraattee,, ppaacckkeett--ssuubb--bbiittrraattee
              Old and deprecated properties for vviiddeeoo--bbiittrraattee, aauuddiioo--bbiittrraattee, ssuubb--bbiittrraattee. They behave
              exactly  the same, but return a value in kilobits. Also, they don't have any OSD format‐
              ting, though the same can be achieved with e.g. $${{==vviiddeeoo--bbiittrraattee}}.

              These properties shouldn't be used anymore.

       aauuddiioo--ddeevviiccee--lliisstt
              Return the list of discovered audio devices. This is mostly for use with the client API,
              and reflects what ----aauuddiioo--ddeevviiccee==hheellpp with the command line player returns.

              When  querying  the  property  with  the  client  API using MMPPVV__FFOORRMMAATT__NNOODDEE, or with Lua
              mmpp..ggeett__pprrooppeerrttyy__nnaattiivvee, this will return a mpv_node with the following contents:

                 MPV_FORMAT_NODE_ARRAY
                     MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP (for each device entry)
                         "name"          MPV_FORMAT_STRING
                         "description"   MPV_FORMAT_STRING

              The nnaammee is what is to be passed to the ----aauuddiioo--ddeevviiccee option (and often a rather  cryp‐
              tic  audio  API-specific  ID),  while  ddeessccrriippttiioonn is human readable free form text. The
              description is set to the device  name  (minus  mpv-specific  <<ddrriivveerr>>//  prefix)  if  no
              description is available or the description would have been an empty string.

              The  special entry with the name set to aauuttoo selects the default audio output driver and
              the default device.

              The property can be watched with the property observation mechanism in  the  client  API
              and  in  Lua  scripts.  (Technically, change notification is enabled the first time this
              property is read.)

       aauuddiioo--ddeevviiccee ((RRWW))
              Set the audio device. This directly reads/writes the ----aauuddiioo--ddeevviiccee option, but on write
              accesses, the audio output will be scheduled for reloading.

              Writing  this  property  while  no  audio output is active will not automatically enable
              audio. (This is also true in the case when audio was disabled  due  to  reinitialization
              failure after a previous write access to aauuddiioo--ddeevviiccee.)

              This property also doesn't tell you which audio device is actually in use.

              How these details are handled may change in the future.

       ccuurrrreenntt--vvoo
              Current video output driver (name as used with ----vvoo).

       ccuurrrreenntt--aaoo
              Current audio output driver (name as used with ----aaoo).

       wwoorrkkiinngg--ddiirreeccttoorryy
              Return  the  working  directory  of  the  mpv process. Can be useful for JSON IPC users,
              because the command line player usually works with relative paths.

       pprroottooccooll--lliisstt
              List of protocol prefixes potentially recognized by the player. They are returned  with‐
              out  trailing  :://// suffix (which is still always required).  In some cases, the protocol
              will not actually be supported (consider hhttttppss if ffmpeg is not compiled with  TLS  sup‐
              port).

       ddeeccooddeerr--lliisstt
              List of decoders supported. This lists decoders which can be passed to ----vvdd and ----aadd.

              ccooddeecc  Canonical codec name, which identifies the format the decoder can handle.

              ddrriivveerr The  name  of the decoder itself. Often, this is the same as ccooddeecc.  Sometimes it
                     can be different. It is used to distinguish multiple decoders for the same codec.

              ddeessccrriippttiioonn
                     Human readable description of the decoder and codec.

              When querying the property with the  client  API  using  MMPPVV__FFOORRMMAATT__NNOODDEE,  or  with  Lua
              mmpp..ggeett__pprrooppeerrttyy__nnaattiivvee, this will return a mpv_node with the following contents:

                 MPV_FORMAT_NODE_ARRAY
                     MPV_FORMAT_NODE_MAP (for each decoder entry)
                         "codec"         MPV_FORMAT_STRING
                         "driver"        MPV_FORMAT_STRING
                         "description"   MPV_FORMAT_STRING

       eennccooddeerr--lliisstt
              List  of  libavcodec  encoders.  This  has the same format as ddeeccooddeerr--lliisstt.  The encoder
              names (ddrriivveerr entries) can be passed to  ----oovvcc  and  ----ooaacc  (without  the  llaavvcc::  prefix
              required by ----vvdd and ----aadd).

       ddeemmuuxxeerr--llaavvff--lliisstt
              List of available libavformat demuxers' names. This can be used to check for support for
              a specific format or use with ----ddeemmuuxxeerr--llaavvff--ffoorrmmaatt.

       mmppvv--vveerrssiioonn
              Return the mpv version/copyright string. Depending on how the binary was built, it might
              contain either a release version, or just a git hash.

       mmppvv--ccoonnffiigguurraattiioonn
              Return  the configuration arguments which were passed to the build system (typically the
              way ..//wwaaff ccoonnffiigguurree ...... was invoked).

       ffffmmppeegg--vveerrssiioonn
              Return the contents of the aavv__vveerrssiioonn__iinnffoo(()) API call. This is a string which identifies
              the  build  in  some  way,  either through a release version number, or a git hash. This
              applies to Libav as well (the property is  still  named  the  same.)  This  property  is
              unavailable if mpv is linked against older FFmpeg and Libav versions.

       ooppttiioonnss//<<nnaammee>> ((RRWW))
              Read-only  access to value of option ----<<nnaammee>>. Most options can be changed at runtime by
              writing to this property. Note that many options require reloading the file for  changes
              to take effect. If there is an equivalent property, prefer setting the property instead.

              There shouldn't be any reason to access ooppttiioonnss//<<nnaammee>> instead of <<nnaammee>>, except in sit‐
              uations in which the properties have different behavior or conflicting semantics.

       ffiillee--llooccaall--ooppttiioonnss//<<nnaammee>>
              Similar to ooppttiioonnss//<<nnaammee>>, but when setting an option through this property, the  option
              is  reset to its old value once the current file has stopped playing. Trying to write an
              option while no file is playing (or is being loaded) results in an error.

              (Note that if an option is marked as file-local, even ooppttiioonnss//  will  access  the  local
              value,  and  the oolldd value, which will be restored on end of playback, cannot be read or
              written until end of playback.)

       ooppttiioonn--iinnffoo//<<nnaammee>>
              Additional per-option information.

              This has a number of sub-properties. Replace <<nnaammee>> with the name of a top-level option.
              No guarantee of stability is given to any of these sub-properties - they may change rad‐
              ically in the feature.

              ooppttiioonn--iinnffoo//<<nnaammee>>//nnaammee
                     Returns the name of the option.

              ooppttiioonn--iinnffoo//<<nnaammee>>//ttyyppee
                     Return the name of the option type, like SSttrriinngg or  IInntteeggeerr.   For  many  complex
                     types, this isn't very accurate.

              ooppttiioonn--iinnffoo//<<nnaammee>>//sseett--ffrroomm--ccoommmmaannddlliinnee
                     Return  yyeess  if  the option was set from the mpv command line, nnoo otherwise. What
                     this is set to if the option is e.g. changed at runtime is left undefined  (mean‐
                     ing it could change in the future).

              ooppttiioonn--iinnffoo//<<nnaammee>>//sseett--llooccaallllyy
                     Return  yyeess  if  the option was set per-file. This is the case with automatically
                     loaded profiles, file-dir configs, and other cases. It  means  the  option  value
                     will be restored to the value before playback start when playback ends.

              ooppttiioonn--iinnffoo//<<nnaammee>>//ddeeffaauulltt--vvaalluuee

                     Integer  minimum and maximum values allowed for the option. Only available if the
                     options are numeric, and the minimum/maximum has been set internally.  It's  also
                     possible that only one of these is set.

       pprrooffiillee--lliisstt
              Return the list of profiles and their contents. This is highly  implementation-specific,
              and  may  change  any  time. Currently, it returns an array of options for each profile.
              Each option has a name and a value, with the value currently always being a string. Note
              that  the  options array is not a map, as order matters and duplicate entries are possi‐
              ble. Recursive profiles are not expanded, and show up as special pprrooffiillee options.

       You can access (almost) all options as properties, though there  are  some  caveats  with  some
       properties (due to historical reasons):

       vviidd,, aaiidd,, ssiidd
              While  playback  is active, you can set existing tracks only. (The option allows setting
              any track ID, and which tracks to enable is chosen at loading time.)

              Option changes at runtime are affected by this as well.

       vviiddeeoo--aassppeecctt
              While video is active, always returns the effective  aspect  ratio.  Setting  a  special
              value (like nnoo, values <<== 00) will make the property set this as option, and return what‐
              ever actual aspect was derived from the option setting.

       ddiissppllaayy--ffppss
              If a VO is created, this will return either the actual display FPS, or an invalid value,
              instead of the option value.

       vvff,, aaff If  you  set the properties during playback, and the filter chain fails to reinitialize,
              the new value will be rejected. Setting the option or setting the  property  outside  of
              playback  will always succeed/fail in the same way. Also, there are no vvff--aadddd etc. prop‐
              erties, but you can use the vvff/aaff group of commands to achieve the same.

              Option changes at runtime are affected by this as well.

       eeddiittiioonn
              While a file is loaded, the property will always return the effective edition, and  set‐
              ting the aauuttoo value will show somewhat strange behavior (the property eventually switch‐
              ing to whatever is the default edition).

       ppllaayylliisstt
              The property is read-only and returns the current internal playlist. The option  is  for
              loading  playlist  during  command line parsing. For client API uses, you should use the
              llooaaddlliisstt command instead.

       wwiinnddooww--ssccaallee
              Might verify the set value when setting while a window is created.

       aauuddiioo--ffiillee,, ssuubb--ffiillee,, eexxtteerrnnaall--ffiillee
              These options/properties are actually lists  of  filenames.  To  make  the  command-line
              interface  easier,  each ----aauuddiioo--ffiillee==...... option appends the full string to the internal
              list. However, when used as properties, every time you set the property as a string  the
              internal  list  will be replaced with a single entry containing the string you set. ,, or
              other separators are never used. You have to use MMPPVV__FFOORRMMAATT__NNOODDEE__AARRRRAAYY (or corresponding
              API, e.g. mmpp..sseett__pprrooppeerrttyy__nnaattiivvee(()) with a table in Lua) to set multiple entries.

              Strictly  speaking,  option  access  via API (e.g. mmppvv__sseett__ooppttiioonn__ssttrriinngg(())) has the same
              problem, and it's only a difference between CLI/API.

       ppllaayylliisstt--ppooss,, cchhaapptteerr
              These properties behave different from the deprecated options with the same names.

       pprrooffiillee,, iinncclluuddee
              These are write-only, and will perform actions as they are written  to,  exactly  as  if
              they  were  used  on the mpv CLI commandline. Their only use is when using libmpv before
              mmppvv__iinniittiiaalliizzee(()), which in turn is probably only useful in encoding mode. Normal  libmpv
              users  should  use  other  mechanisms,  such  as  the  aappppllyy--pprrooffiillee  command,  and  the
              mmppvv__llooaadd__ccoonnffiigg__ffiillee API function. Avoid these properties.

   PPrrooppeerrttyy EExxppaannssiioonn
       All string arguments to input commands as well as certain options (like ----tteerrmm--ppllaayyiinngg--mmssgg) are
       subject  to property expansion. Note that property expansion does not work in places where e.g.
       numeric parameters are expected.  (For example, the aadddd command does not do property expansion.
       The sseett command is an exception and not a general rule.)

          Example for input.conf

          ii sshhooww--tteexxtt FFiilleennaammee:: $${{ffiilleennaammee}}
                 shows the filename of the current file when pressing the ii key

       Within  iinnppuutt..ccoonnff,  property  expansion can be inhibited by putting the rraaww prefix in front of
       commands.

       The following expansions are supported:

       $${{NNAAMMEE}}
              Expands to the value of the property NNAAMMEE. If retrieving the property fails,  expand  to
              an  error string. (Use $${{NNAAMMEE::}} with a trailing :: to expand to an empty string instead.)
              If NNAAMMEE is prefixed with ==, expand to the raw value of the property (see section below).

       $${{NNAAMMEE::SSTTRR}}
              Expands to the value of the property NNAAMMEE, or SSTTRR if the property cannot  be  retrieved.
              SSTTRR is expanded recursively.

       $${{??NNAAMMEE::SSTTRR}}
              Expands to SSTTRR (recursively) if the property NNAAMMEE is available.

       $${{!!NNAAMMEE::SSTTRR}}
              Expands to SSTTRR (recursively) if the property NNAAMMEE cannot be retrieved.

       $${{??NNAAMMEE====VVAALLUUEE::SSTTRR}}
              Expands  to  SSTTRR  (recursively) if the property NNAAMMEE expands to a string equal to VVAALLUUEE.
              You can prefix NNAAMMEE with == in order to compare the raw value of a property (see  section
              below).  If  the property is unavailable, or other errors happen when retrieving it, the
              value is never considered equal.  Note that VVAALLUUEE can't contain any of the characters  ::
              or  }}.   Also,  it  is  possible that escaping with "" or %% might be added in the future,
              should the need arise.

       $${{!!NNAAMMEE====VVAALLUUEE::SSTTRR}}
              Same as with the ?? variant, but SSTTRR is expanded if the value is not  equal.  (Using  the
              same semantics as with ??.)

       $$$$     Expands to $$.

       $$}}     Expands to }}. (To produce this character inside recursive expansion.)

       $$>>     Disable property expansion and special handling of $$ for the rest of the string.

       In  places  where  property  expansion  is allowed, C-style escapes are often accepted as well.
       Example:

          · \\nn becomes a newline character

          · \\\\ expands to \\

       Normally, properties are formatted as human-readable text, meant to be displayed on OSD  or  on
       the  terminal. It is possible to retrieve an unformatted (raw) value from a property by prefix‐
       ing its name with ==. These raw values can be parsed by other programs and follow the same  con‐
       ventions as the options associated with the properties.

          Examples

          · $${{ttiimmee--ppooss}} expands to 0000::1144::2233 (if playback position is at 14 minutes 23 seconds)

          · $${{==ttiimmee--ppooss}}  expands  to  886633..44 (same time, plus 400 milliseconds - milliseconds are nor‐
            mally not shown in the formatted case)

       Sometimes, the difference in amount of information carried by raw and formatted property values
       can  be rather big. In some cases, raw values have more information, like higher precision than
       seconds with ttiimmee--ppooss. Sometimes it is the other way around, e.g. aaiidd  shows  track  title  and
       language in the formatted case, but only the track number if it is raw.

       The  On  Screen  Controller  (short:  OSC)  is a minimal GUI integrated with mpv to offer basic
       mouse-controllability. It is intended to make interaction easier for new users  and  to  enable
       precise and direct seeking.

       The OSC is enabled by default if mpv was compiled with Lua support. It can be disabled entirely
       using the ----oosscc==nnoo option.

   UUssiinngg tthhee OOSSCC
       By default, the OSC will show up whenever the mouse is moved inside the player window and  will
       hide  if the mouse is not moved outside the OSC for 0.5 seconds or if the mouse leaves the win‐
       dow.

       These key bindings are active by default if nothing else is already bound  to  these  keys.  In
       case  of  collision, the function needs to be bound to a different key. See the _S_c_r_i_p_t _C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s

   CCoonnffiigguurraattiioonn
       The OSC offers limited configuration through a config file ssccrriipptt--ooppttss//oosscc..ccoonnff placed in mpv's
       user dir and through the ----ssccrriipptt--ooppttss command-line option. Options provided through  the  com‐
       mand-line will override those from the config file.

   CCoonnffiigg SSyynnttaaxx
       The config file must exactly follow the following syntax:

          # this is a comment
          optionA=value1
          optionB=value2

       ##  can  only be used at the beginning of a line and there may be no spaces around the == or any‐
       where else.

   CCoommmmaanndd--lliinnee SSyynnttaaxx
       To avoid collisions with other scripts, all options need to be prefixed with oosscc--.

       Example:

          --script-opts=osc-optionA=value1,osc-optionB=value2

   CCoonnffiigguurraabbllee OOppttiioonnss
       llaayyoouutt Default: bottombar

              The layout for the OSC. Currently available are: box,  slimbox,  bottombar  and  topbar.
              Default pre-0.21.0 was 'box'.

       sseeeekkbbaarrssttyyllee
              Default: bar

              Sets the style of the seekbar, slider (diamond marker), knob (circle marker with guide),
              or bar (fill).  Default pre-0.21.0 was 'slider'.

       sseeeekkbbaarrkkeeyyffrraammeess
              Default: yes

              Controls the mode used to seek when dragging the  seekbar.  By  default,  keyframes  are
              used.  If set to false, exact seeking on mouse drags will be used instead. Keyframes are
              preferred, but exact seeks may be useful in cases where keyframes cannot be found.  Note
              that using exact seeks can potentially make mouse dragging much slower.

       ddeeaaddzzoonneessiizzee
              Default: 0.5

              Size  of the deadzone. The deadzone is an area that makes the mouse act like leaving the
              window. Movement there won't make the OSC show up and it will hide  immediately  if  the
              mouse  enters  it.  The deadzone starts at the window border opposite to the OSC and the
              size controls how much of the window it will span. Values between 0.0 and 1.0,  where  0
              means  the  OSC will always popup with mouse movement in the window, and 1 means the OSC
              will only show up when the mouse hovers it. Default pre-0.21.0 was 0.

       mmiinnmmoouusseemmoovvee
              Default: 0

              Minimum amount of pixels the mouse has to move between ticks to make the  OSC  show  up.
              Default pre-0.21.0 was 3.

       sshhoowwwwiinnddoowweedd
              Default: yes

       ssccaalleeffoorrcceeddwwiinnddooww
              Default: 2.0

              Scale factor of the OSC when rendered on a forced (dummy) window

       vviiddssccaallee
              Default: yes

              Scale  the OSC with the video nnoo tries to keep the OSC size constant as much as the win‐
              dow size allows

       vvaalliiggnn Default: 0.8

              Vertical alignment, -1 (top) to 1 (bottom)

       hhaalliiggnn Default: 0.0

              Horizontal alignment, -1 (left) to 1 (right)

       bbaarrmmaarrggiinn
              Default: 0

              Margin from bottom (bottombar) or top (topbar), in pixels

       bbooxxaallpphhaa
              Default: 80

              Alpha of the background box, 0 (opaque) to 255 (fully transparent)

       hhiiddeettiimmeeoouutt
              Default: 500

              Duration in ms until the OSC hides if no mouse movement, must not be negative

       ffaaddeedduurraattiioonn
              Default: 200

              Duration of fade out in ms, 0 = no fade

       ttiittllee  Default: ${media-title}

              String that supports property expansion that will be displayed as OSC title.   ASS  tags
              are escaped, and newlines and trailing slashes are stripped.

       ttoooollttiippbboorrddeerr
              Default: 1

              Size of the tooltip outline when using bottombar or topbar layouts

       ttiimmeettoottaall
              Default: no

              Show total time instead of time remaining

       ttiimmeemmss Default: no

              Display timecodes with milliseconds

       sseeeekkrraannggeess
              Default: yes

              Display seekable ranges on the seekbar

       vviissiibbiilliittyy
              Default: auto (auto hide/show on mouse move)

              Also supports nneevveerr and aallwwaayyss

       bbooxxmmaaxxcchhaarrss
              Default: 80

              Max  chars  for  the osc title at the box layout. mpv does not measure the text width on
              screen and so it needs to limit it by number of chars. The default  is  conservative  to
              allow  wide fonts to be used without overflow.  However, with many common fonts a bigger
              number can be used. YMMV.

   SSccrriipptt CCoommmmaannddss
       The OSC script listens to certain script commands. These commands can bound in  iinnppuutt..ccoonnff,  or
       sent by other scripts.

       oosscc--mmeessssaaggee
              Show  a message on screen using the OSC. First argument is the message, second the dura‐
              tion in seconds.

       oosscc--vviissiibbiilliittyy
              Controls visibility mode nneevveerr / aauuttoo (on mouse move) / aallwwaayyss and also ccyyccllee  to  cycle
              between the modes

       Example

       You  could  put  this  into iinnppuutt..ccoonnff to hide the OSC with the aa key and to set auto mode (the
       default) with bb:

          a script-message osc-visibility never
          b script-message osc-visibility auto

       oosscc--ppllaayylliisstt,, oosscc--cchhaapptteerrlliisstt,, oosscc--ttrraacckklliisstt
              Shows a limited view of the respective type of list using the  OSC.  First  argument  is
              duration in seconds.

SSTTAATTSS
       This  builtin  script  displays information and statistics for the currently played file. It is
       enabled by default if mpv was compiled with Lua support.  It can be disabled entirely using the
       ----llooaadd--ssttaattss--oovveerrllaayy==nnoo option.

   UUssaaggee
       The  following  key  bindings  are  active by default unless something else is already bound to
       them:

                                  ┌──┬────────────────────────────────────┐
                                  │i │ Show stats for a fixed duration    │

       While  the  stats  are  visible  on screen the following key bindings are active, regardless of
       existing bindings. They allow you to switch between _p_a_g_e_s of stats:

   FFoonntt
       For optimal visual experience, a font with support for many font weights and monospaced  digits
       is recommended. By default, the open source font _S_o_u_r_c_e _S_a_n_s _P_r_o is used.

   CCoonnffiigguurraattiioonn
       This script can be customized through a config file ssccrriipptt--ooppttss//ssttaattss..ccoonnff placed in mpv's user
       directory and through the  ----ssccrriipptt--ooppttss  command-line  option.  The  configuration  syntax  is
       described in _O_N _S_C_R_E_E_N _C_O_N_T_R_O_L_L_E_R.

       ppeerrssiisstteenntt__oovveerrllaayy
              Default: no

              When  _n_o,  other  scripts printing text to the screen can overwrite the displayed stats.
              When _y_e_s, displayed stats are persistently shown for the respective duration.  This  can
              result in overlapping text when multiple scripts decide to print text at the same time.

       pplloott__ppeerrffddaattaa

LLUUAA SSCCRRIIPPTTIINNGG
       mpv can load Lua scripts. Scripts passed to the ----ssccrriipptt option, or found in the ssccrriippttss subdi‐
       rectory  of  the mpv configuration directory (usually ~~//..ccoonnffiigg//mmppvv//ssccrriippttss//) will be loaded on
       program start. mpv also appends the ssccrriippttss subdirectory to the end of Lua's path  so  you  can
       import  scripts  from  there  too.  Since it's added to the end, don't name scripts you want to
       import the same as Lua libraries because they will be overshadowed by them.

       mpv provides the built-in module mmpp, which contains functions to send commands to the mpv  core
       and to retrieve information about playback state, user settings, file information, and so on.

       These  scripts can be used to control mpv in a similar way to slave mode.  Technically, the Lua
       code uses the client API internally.

       A script which leaves fullscreen mode when the player is paused:

          function on_pause_change(name, value)
              if value == true then
                  mp.set_property("fullscreen", "no")
              end
          end
          mp.observe_property("pause", "bool", on_pause_change)

   DDeettaaiillss oonn tthhee ssccrriipptt iinniittiiaalliizzaattiioonn aanndd lliiffeeccyyccllee
       Your script will be loaded by the player at program start from the ssccrriippttss configuration subdi‐
       rectory,  or from a path specified with the ----ssccrriipptt option. Some scripts are loaded internally
       (like ----oosscc). Each script runs in its own thread. Your script is first run "as  is",  and  once
       that  is  done, the event loop is entered. This event loop will dispatch events received by mpv
       and call your own event handlers which you have registered with  mmpp..rreeggiisstteerr__eevveenntt,  or  timers
       added  with mmpp..aadddd__ttiimmeeoouutt or similar. Note that since the script starts execution concurrently
       with player initialization, some properties may not be populated with meaningful  values  until
       the relevant subsystems have initialized.

       When  the  player  quits,  all  scripts will be asked to terminate. This happens via a sshhuuttddoowwnn
       event, which by default will make the event loop return. If your script  got  into  an  endless
       loop,  mpv  will  probably  behave  fine during playback, but it won't terminate when quitting,
       because it's waiting on your script.

       Internally, the C code will call the Lua function mmpp__eevveenntt__lloooopp after  loading  a  Lua  script.
       This  function  is  normally  defined  by  the  default  prelude loaded before your script (see
       ppllaayyeerr//lluuaa//ddeeffaauullttss..lluuaa in the mpv sources).  The event loop will wait for events and  dispatch
       events  registered with mmpp..rreeggiisstteerr__eevveenntt. It will also handle timers added with mmpp..aadddd__ttiimmeeoouutt
       and similar (by waiting with a timeout).

       Since mpv 0.6.0, the player will wait until the script is fully loaded before continuing normal
       operation.  The  player considers a script as fully loaded as soon as it starts waiting for mpv
       events (or it exits). In practice this means the player will more or less hang until the script
       returns from the main chunk (and mmpp__eevveenntt__lloooopp is called), or the script calls mmpp__eevveenntt__lloooopp or
       mmpp..ddiissppaattcchh__eevveennttss directly. This is done to make it possible for a script to fully setup event
       handlers  etc.  before  playback  actually  starts.  In older mpv versions, this happened asyn‐
       chronously. With mpv 0.29.0, this changes slightly, and it  merely  waits  for  scripts  to  be
       loaded  in  this  manner  before  starting playback as part of the player initialization phase.
       Scripts run though initialization in parallel. This might change again.

   mmpp ffuunnccttiioonnss
       The mmpp module is preloaded, although it can be loaded manually with rreeqquuiirree ''mmpp''.  It  provides
       the core client API.

       mmpp..ccoommmmaanndd((ssttrriinngg))
              Run  the given command. This is similar to the commands used in input.conf.  See _L_i_s_t _o_f
              _I_n_p_u_t _C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s.

              By default, this will show something on the OSD (depending on the command), as if it was
              used in iinnppuutt..ccoonnff. See _I_n_p_u_t _C_o_m_m_a_n_d _P_r_e_f_i_x_e_s how to influence OSD usage per command.

              Returns ttrruuee on success, or nniill,, eerrrroorr on error.

       mmpp..ccoommmmaannddvv((aarrgg11,, aarrgg22,, ......))
              Similar  to  mmpp..ccoommmmaanndd,  but pass each command argument as separate parameter. This has
              the advantage that you don't have to care about quoting and escaping in some cases.

              Example:

                 mp.command("loadfile " .. filename .. " append")
                 mp.commandv("loadfile", filename, "append")

              These two commands are equivalent, except that the first version breaks if the  filename
              contains spaces or certain special characters.

              Note  that properties are _n_o_t expanded.  You can use either mmpp..ccoommmmaanndd, the eexxppaanndd--pprroopp‐‐
              eerrttiieess prefix, or the mmpp..ggeett__pprrooppeerrttyy family of functions.

              Unlike mmpp..ccoommmmaanndd, this will not use OSD by default either (except for some OSD-specific
              commands).

       mmpp..ccoommmmaanndd__nnaattiivvee((ttaabbllee [[,,ddeeff]]))
              Similar to mmpp..ccoommmmaannddvv, but pass the argument list as table. This has the advantage that
              in at least some cases, arguments can be passed as native types.

              Returns a result table on success (usually empty), or ddeeff,, eerrrroorr on error.  ddeeff  is  the
              second parameter provided to the function, and is nil if it's missing.

       mmpp..ggeett__pprrooppeerrttyy((nnaammee [[,,ddeeff]]))
              Return  the value of the given property as string. These are the same properties as used
              in input.conf. See _P_r_o_p_e_r_t_i_e_s for a list of properties. The returned string is formatted
              similar to $${{==nnaammee}} (see _P_r_o_p_e_r_t_y _E_x_p_a_n_s_i_o_n).

              Returns  the string on success, or ddeeff,, eerrrroorr on error. ddeeff is the second parameter pro‐
              vided to the function, and is nil if it's missing.

       mmpp..ggeett__pprrooppeerrttyy__oossdd((nnaammee [[,,ddeeff]]))
              Similar to mmpp..ggeett__pprrooppeerrttyy, but return the property value formatted for OSD. This is the
              same string as printed with $${{nnaammee}} when used in input.conf.

              Returns  the string on success, or ddeeff,, eerrrroorr on error. ddeeff is the second parameter pro‐
              vided to the function, and is an empty string if it's  missing.  Unlike  ggeett__pprrooppeerrttyy(()),
              assigning the return value to a variable will always result in a string.

       mmpp..ggeett__pprrooppeerrttyy__bbooooll((nnaammee [[,,ddeeff]]))
              Similar to mmpp..ggeett__pprrooppeerrttyy, but return the property value as Boolean.

              Returns a Boolean on success, or ddeeff,, eerrrroorr on error.

       mmpp..ggeett__pprrooppeerrttyy__nnuummbbeerr((nnaammee [[,,ddeeff]]))
              Similar to mmpp..ggeett__pprrooppeerrttyy, but return the property value as number.

              Note  that while Lua does not distinguish between integers and floats, mpv internals do.
              This function simply request a double float from mpv, and mpv will usually convert inte‐
              ger property values to float.

              Returns a number on success, or ddeeff,, eerrrroorr on error.

       mmpp..ggeett__pprrooppeerrttyy__nnaattiivvee((nnaammee [[,,ddeeff]]))
              Similar  to  mmpp..ggeett__pprrooppeerrttyy,  but return the property value using the best Lua type for
              the property. Most time, this will return a string, Boolean, or number. Some  properties
              (for example cchhaapptteerr--lliisstt) are returned as tables.

              Returns  a  value on success, or ddeeff,, eerrrroorr on error. Note that nniill might be a possible,
              valid value too in some corner cases.

       mmpp..sseett__pprrooppeerrttyy((nnaammee,, vvaalluuee))
              Set the given property to the given string value. See mmpp..ggeett__pprrooppeerrttyy and _P_r_o_p_e_r_t_i_e_s for
              more information about properties.

              Returns true on success, or nniill,, eerrrroorr on error.

       mmpp..sseett__pprrooppeerrttyy__bbooooll((nnaammee,, vvaalluuee))
              Similar to mmpp..sseett__pprrooppeerrttyy, but set the given property to the given Boolean value.

       mmpp..sseett__pprrooppeerrttyy__nnuummbbeerr((nnaammee,, vvaalluuee))
              Similar to mmpp..sseett__pprrooppeerrttyy, but set the given property to the given numeric value.

              Note  that while Lua does not distinguish between integers and floats, mpv internals do.
              This function will test whether the number can be represented as integer, and if so,  it
              will pass an integer value to mpv, otherwise a double float.

       mmpp..sseett__pprrooppeerrttyy__nnaattiivvee((nnaammee,, vvaalluuee))
              Similar to mmpp..sseett__pprrooppeerrttyy, but set the given property using its native type.

              Since  there are several data types which cannot represented natively in Lua, this might
              not always work as expected. For example, while the Lua wrapper can do some guesswork to
              decide  whether  a  Lua  table  is an array or a map, this would fail with empty tables.
              Also, there are not many properties for which it makes sense to  use  this,  instead  of
              sseett__pprrooppeerrttyy,  sseett__pprrooppeerrttyy__bbooooll, sseett__pprrooppeerrttyy__nnuummbbeerr.  For these reasons, this function
              should probably be avoided for now, except for properties that use tables natively.

       mmpp..ggeett__ttiimmee(())
              Return the current mpv internal time in seconds as a number. This is basically the  sys‐
              tem time, with an arbitrary offset.

       mmpp..aadddd__kkeeyy__bbiinnddiinngg((kkeeyy,, nnaammee||ffnn [[,,ffnn [[,,ffllaaggss]]]]))
              Register  callback  to  be run on a key binding. The binding will be mapped to the given
              kkeeyy, which is a string describing the physical key. This uses the same key names  as  in
              input.conf,  and  also allows combinations (e.g. ccttrrll++aa). If the key is empty or nniill, no
              physical key is registered, but the user still can create own bindings (see below).

              After calling this function, key presses will cause the function ffnn to be called (unless
              the user remapped the key with another binding).

              The nnaammee argument should be a short symbolic string. It allows the user to remap the key
              binding via input.conf using the ssccrriipptt--mmeessssaaggee command, and the name of the key binding
              (see  below for an example). The name should be unique across other bindings in the same
              script - if not, the previous binding with the same name will be  overwritten.  You  can
              omit the name, in which case a random name is generated internally.

              The  last  argument is used for optional flags. This is a table, which can have the fol‐
              lowing entries:

                 rreeppeeaattaabbllee
                        If set to ttrruuee, enables key repeat for this specific binding.

                 ccoommpplleexx
                        If set to ttrruuee, then ffnn is called on both key up and down events (as  well  as
                        key repeat, if enabled), with the first argument being a table. This table has
                        an eevveenntt entry, which is set to one of the strings ddoowwnn, rreeppeeaatt, uupp  or  pprreessss
                        (the  latter  if  key  up/down  can't  be tracked). It further has an iiss__mmoouussee
                        entry, which tells whether the event was caused by a mouse button.

              Internally, key bindings are dispatched  via  the  ssccrriipptt--mmeessssaaggee--ttoo  or  ssccrriipptt--bbiinnddiinngg
              input commands and mmpp..rreeggiisstteerr__ssccrriipptt__mmeessssaaggee.

              Trying to map multiple commands to a key will essentially prefer a random binding, while
              the other bindings are not called. It is guaranteed that user defined  bindings  in  the
              central  input.conf  are  preferred  over  bindings  added  with  this function (but see
              mmpp..aadddd__ffoorrcceedd__kkeeyy__bbiinnddiinngg).

              Example:

                 function something_handler()
                     print("the key was pressed")
                 end
                 mp.add_key_binding("x", "something", something_handler)

              This will print the message tthhee kkeeyy wwaass pprreesssseedd when xx was pressed.

              The user can remap these key bindings. Then the user has to put the following into their
              input.conf to remap the command to the yy key:

                 y script-binding something

              This  will  print  the message when the key yy is pressed. (xx will still work, unless the
              user remaps it.)

              You can also explicitly send a message to a named script only. Assume the  above  script
              was using the filename ffoooossccrriipptt..lluuaa:

                 y script-binding fooscript/something

       mmpp..aadddd__ffoorrcceedd__kkeeyy__bbiinnddiinngg((......))
              This works almost the same as mmpp..aadddd__kkeeyy__bbiinnddiinngg, but registers the key binding in a way
              that will overwrite the user's custom bindings in their input.conf.  (mmpp..aadddd__kkeeyy__bbiinnddiinngg
              overwrites default key bindings only, but not those by the user's input.conf.)

       mmpp..rreemmoovvee__kkeeyy__bbiinnddiinngg((nnaammee))
              Remove a key binding added with mmpp..aadddd__kkeeyy__bbiinnddiinngg or mmpp..aadddd__ffoorrcceedd__kkeeyy__bbiinnddiinngg. Use the
              same name as you used when adding the bindings. It's not possible to remove bindings for
              which you omitted the name.

       mmpp..rreeggiisstteerr__eevveenntt((nnaammee,, ffnn))
              Call  a  specific  function  when  an event happens. The event name is a string, and the
              function fn is a Lua function value.

              Some events have associated data. This is put into a Lua table and passed as argument to
              fn.  The  Lua  table  by default contains a nnaammee field, which is a string containing the
              event name. If the event has an error associated, the eerrrroorr field is  set  to  a  string
              describing the error, on success it's not set.

              If  multiple  functions  are registered for the same event, they are run in registration
              order, which the first registered function running before all the other ones.

              Returns true if such an event exists, false otherwise.

              Undo mmpp..rreeggiisstteerr__eevveenntt((......,, ffnn)). This removes all event handlers that are equal  to  the
              ffnn  parameter.  This uses normal Lua ==== comparison, so be careful when dealing with clo‐
              sures.

       mmpp..oobbsseerrvvee__pprrooppeerrttyy((nnaammee,, ttyyppee,, ffnn))
              Watch a property for changes. If  the  property  nnaammee  is  changed,  then  the  function
              ffnn((nnaammee))  will  be  called.  ttyyppee  can  be  nniill, or be set to one of nnoonnee, nnaattiivvee, bbooooll,
              ssttrriinngg, or nnuummbbeerr.  nnoonnee is the same as nniill. For all other values, the new value of  the
              property  will  be  passed  as  second  argument  to ffnn, using mmpp..ggeett__pprrooppeerrttyy__<<ttyyppee>> to
              retrieve it. This means if ttyyppee is for example  ssttrriinngg,  ffnn  is  roughly  called  as  in
              ffnn((nnaammee,, mmpp..ggeett__pprrooppeerrttyy__ssttrriinngg((nnaammee)))).

              If possible, change events are coalesced. If a property is changed a bunch of times in a
              row, only the last change triggers the change function. (The exact behavior  depends  on
              timing and other things.)

              In some cases the function is not called even if the property changes.  Whether this can
              happen depends on the property.

              If the ttyyppee is nnoonnee or nniill, sporadic property change events are possible. This means the
              change function ffnn can be called even if the property doesn't actually change.

       mmpp..uunnoobbsseerrvvee__pprrooppeerrttyy((ffnn))
              Undo  mmpp..oobbsseerrvvee__pprrooppeerrttyy((......,, ffnn)). This removes all property handlers that are equal to
              the ffnn parameter. This uses normal Lua ==== comparison, so be careful  when  dealing  with
              closures.

              Call  the given function fn when the given number of seconds has elapsed.  Note that the
              number of seconds can be fractional. For now, the timer's resolution may be as low as 50
              ms, although this will be improved in the future.

              This is a one-shot timer: it will be removed when it's fired.

              Returns a timer object. See mmpp..aadddd__ppeerriiooddiicc__ttiimmeerr for details.

              Call  the  given  function  periodically.  This is like mmpp..aadddd__ttiimmeeoouutt, but the timer is
              re-added after the function fn is run.

                     ssttoopp(()) Disable the timer. Does nothing if the timer is  already  disabled.   This
                            will  remember  the  current  elapsed time when stopping, so that rreessuummee(())
                            essentially unpauses the timer.

                     kkiillll(()) Disable the timer. Resets the elapsed  time.  rreessuummee(())  will  restart  the
                            timer.

                     rreessuummee(())
                            Restart the timer. If the timer was disabled with ssttoopp(()), this will resume
                            at the time it was stopped. If the timer was disabled with kkiillll(()),  or  if
                            it's  a  previously  fired one-shot timer (added with aadddd__ttiimmeeoouutt(())), this
                            starts the timer from the beginning, using the initially configured  time‐
                            out.

                     iiss__eennaabblleedd(())
                            Whether the timer is currently enabled or was previously disabled (e.g. by
                            ssttoopp(()) or kkiillll(())).

                     ttiimmeeoouutt ((RRWW))
                            This field contains the current timeout period. This value is not  updated
                            as time progresses. It's only used to calculate when the timer should fire
                            next when the timer expires.

                            If you write this, you can call tt::kkiillll(()) ;; tt::rreessuummee(()) to reset the current
                            timeout to the new one. (tt::ssttoopp(()) won't use the new timeout.)

                     oonneesshhoott ((RRWW))
                            Whether  the  timer  is  periodic  (ffaallssee) or fires just once (ttrruuee). This
                            value is used when the timer expires (but before the timer callback  func‐
                            tion fn is run).

              Note  that  these  are  method, and you have to call them using :: instead of .. (Refer to
              _h_t_t_p_:_/_/_w_w_w_._l_u_a_._o_r_g_/_m_a_n_u_a_l_/_5_._2_/_m_a_n_u_a_l_._h_t_m_l_#_3_._4_._9 .)

              Example:

                 timer = mp.add_periodic_timer(1, function()
                     print("called every second")
                     # stop it after 10 seconds
                     seconds = seconds + 1
                     if seconds >= 10 then
                         timer:kill()
                     end
                 end)

       mmpp..ggeett__oopptt((kkeeyy))
              Return a setting from the ----ssccrriipptt--ooppttss option. It's up to the user and the  script  how
              this mechanism is used. Currently, all scripts can access this equally, so you should be
              careful about collisions.

       mmpp..ggeett__ssccrriipptt__nnaammee(())
              Return the name of the current script. The name is usually made of the filename  of  the
              script,  with  directory  and file extension removed. If there are several scripts which
              would have the same name, it's made unique by appending a number.

                 Example

                        The script //ppaatthh//ttoo//ffoooossccrriipptt..lluuaa becomes ffoooossccrriipptt.

              Show an OSD message on the screen.  dduurraattiioonn  is  in  seconds,  and  is  optional  (uses
              ----oossdd--dduurraattiioonn by default).

       mmpp..ssuussppeenndd(())
              This function has been deprecated in mpv 0.21.0  and  does  nothing  starting  with  mpv

       mmpp..ggeett__wwaakkeeuupp__ppiippee(())
              Calls  mmppvv__ggeett__wwaakkeeuupp__ppiippee(()) and returns the read end of the wakeup pipe. This is depre‐
              cated, but still works. (See cclliieenntt..hh for details.)

       mmpp..ggeett__nneexxtt__ttiimmeeoouutt(())
              Return the relative time in seconds when the next  timer  (mmpp..aadddd__ttiimmeeoouutt  and  similar)
              expires. If there is no timer, return nniill.

       mmpp..ddiissppaattcchh__eevveennttss(([[aallllooww__wwaaiitt]]))
              This  can be used to run custom event loops. If you want to have direct control what the
              Lua script does (instead of being called by the default event loop),  you  can  set  the
              global  variable  mmpp__eevveenntt__lloooopp  to  your own function running the event loop. From your
              event loop, you should call mmpp..ddiissppaattcchh__eevveennttss(()) to dequeue and dispatch mpv events.

              If the aallllooww__wwaaiitt parameter is set to ttrruuee, the function will block until the next event
              is  received or the next timer expires. Otherwise (and this is the default behavior), it
              returns as soon as  the  event  loop  is  emptied.  It's  strongly  recommended  to  use
              mmpp..ggeett__nneexxtt__ttiimmeeoouutt(())  and mmpp..ggeett__wwaakkeeuupp__ppiippee(()) if you're interested in properly working
              notification of new events and working timers.

       mmpp..rreeggiisstteerr__iiddllee((ffnn))
              Register an event loop idle handler. Idle handlers are called before the script goes  to
              sleep after handling all new events. This can be used for example to delay processing of
              property change events: if you're observing multiple properties at once, you  might  not
              want  to  act  on each property change, but only when all change notifications have been
              received.

       mmpp..uunnrreeggiisstteerr__iiddllee((ffnn))
              Undo mmpp..rreeggiisstteerr__iiddllee((ffnn)). This removes all idle handlers  that  are  equal  to  the  ffnn
              parameter. This uses normal Lua ==== comparison, so be careful when dealing with closures.

              Set  the  minimum  log  level of which mpv message output to receive. These messages are
              normally printed to the terminal. By calling this function, you can set the minimum  log
              level  of messages which should be received with the lloogg--mmeessssaaggee event. See the descrip‐
              tion of this event for details.  The level is a string, see mmssgg..lloogg for allowed log lev‐
              els.

              This  is  a  helper  to  dispatch ssccrriipptt--mmeessssaaggee or ssccrriipptt--mmeessssaaggee--ttoo invocations to Lua
              functions. ffnn is called if ssccrriipptt--mmeessssaaggee or ssccrriipptt--mmeessssaaggee--ttoo (with this script as des‐
              tination)  is  run  with nnaammee as first parameter. The other parameters are passed to ffnn.
              If a message with the given name is already registered, it's overwritten.

              Used by mmpp..aadddd__kkeeyy__bbiinnddiinngg, so be careful about name collisions.

       ''mmpp..mmssgg''.

       mmssgg..lloogg((lleevveell,, ......))
              The level parameter is the message priority. It's a string  and  one  of  ffaattaall,  eerrrroorr,
              wwaarrnn,  iinnffoo, vv, ddeebbuugg, ttrraaccee. The user's settings will determine which of these messages
              will be visible. Normally, all messages are visible, except vv, ddeebbuugg and ttrraaccee.

              The parameters after that are all converted to strings. Spaces are inserted to  separate
              multiple parameters.

              You don't need to add newlines.

   mmpp..ooppttiioonnss ffuunnccttiioonnss
       mpv comes with a built-in module to manage options from config-files and the command-line.  All
       you  have  to  do  is  to supply a table with default options to the read_options function. The
       function will overwrite the default values with values found in the config-file  and  the  com‐
       mand-line (in that order).

       ooppttiioonnss..rreeaadd__ooppttiioonnss((ttaabbllee [[,, iiddeennttiiffiieerr]]))
              A ttaabbllee with key-value pairs. The type of the default values is important for converting
              the values read from the config file or command-line back. Do not use nniill as  a  default
              value!

              The  iiddeennttiiffiieerr  is used to identify the config-file and the command-line options. These
              needs   to   unique   to   avoid   collisions   with   other   scripts.    Defaults   to

              optionC = true,
          }
          read_options(options, "myscript")
          print(options.optionA)

       The  config  file  will  be stored in ssccrriipptt--ooppttss//iiddeennttiiffiieerr..ccoonnff in mpv's user folder. Comment
       lines can be started with # and stray spaces are not removed.  Boolean values  will  be  repre‐
       sented with yes/no.

       Example config:

          # comment
          optionA=Hello World
          optionB=9999
          optionC=no

       Command-line  options  are read from the ----ssccrriipptt--ooppttss parameter. To avoid collisions, all keys
       have to be prefixed with iiddeennttiiffiieerr--.

       Example command-line:

          --script-opts=myscript-optionA=TEST,myscript-optionB=0,myscript-optionC=yes

       This built-in module provides generic helper functions for  Lua,  and  have  strictly  speaking
       nothing to do with mpv or video/audio playback. They are provided for convenience. Most compen‐
       sate for Lua's scarce standard library.

       Be warned that any of these functions might disappear any time. They are not strictly  part  of
       the guaranteed API.

       uuttiillss..ggeettccwwdd(())
              Returns the directory that mpv was launched from. On error, nniill,, eerrrroorr is returned.

       uuttiillss..rreeaaddddiirr((ppaatthh [[,, ffiilltteerr]]))
              Enumerate  all  entries  at  the given path on the filesystem, and return them as array.
              Each entry is a directory entry (without the path).  The list is unsorted  (in  whatever
              order the operating system returns it).

              If the ffiilltteerr argument is given, it must be one of the following strings:

                 ffiilleess  List  regular  files only. This excludes directories, special files (like UNIX
                        device files or FIFOs), and dead symlinks. It includes UNIX symlinks to  regu‐
                        lar files.

                 ddiirrss   List directories only, or symlinks to directories. .. and ....  are not included.

                 nnoorrmmaall Include the results of both ffiilleess and ddiirrss. (This is the default.)

                 aallll    List  all  entries,  even device files, dead symlinks, FIFOs, and the .. and ....
                        entries.

              On error, nniill,, eerrrroorr is returned.

       uuttiillss..ffiillee__iinnffoo((ppaatthh))
              Stats the given path for information and returns a table with the following entries:

                 mmooddee   protection bits (on Windows,  always  755  (octal)  for  directories  and  644
                        (octal) for files)

                 ssiizzee   size in bytes

                 aattiimmee  time of last access

                 mmttiimmee  time of last modification

                 ccttiimmee  time of last metadata change (Linux) / time of creation (Windows)

                 iiss__ffiillee
                        Whether ppaatthh is a regular file (boolean)

                 iiss__ddiirr Whether ppaatthh is a directory (boolean)

              mmooddee  and  ssiizzee  are  integers.  Timestamps (aattiimmee, mmttiimmee and ccttiimmee) are integer seconds
              since the Unix epoch (Unix time).  The booleans iiss__ffiillee and iiss__ddiirr  are  provided  as  a
              convenience; they can be and are derived from mmooddee.

              On error (eg. path does not exist), nniill,, eerrrroorr is returned.

       uuttiillss..sspplliitt__ppaatthh((ppaatthh))
              Split a path into directory component and filename component, and return them. The first
              return value is always the directory. The second return value is the  trailing  part  of
              the path, the directory entry.

       uuttiillss..jjooiinn__ppaatthh((pp11,, pp22))
              Return  the  concatenation of the 2 paths. Tries to be clever. For example, if ``pp22 is an
              absolute path, p2 is returned without change.

       uuttiillss..ssuubbpprroocceessss((tt))
              Runs an external process and waits until it exits. Returns process status and  the  cap‐
              tured output.

              The parameter tt is a table. The function reads the following entries:

                 aarrggss   Array  of strings. The first array entry is the executable. This can be either
                        an absolute path, or a filename with no path components,  in  which  case  the
                        PPAATTHH  environment  variable is used to resolve the executable. The other array
                        elements are passed as command line arguments.

                 ccaanncceellllaabbllee
                        Optional. If set to ttrruuee (default), then if the user stops playback or goes to
                        the next file while the process is running, the process will be killed.

                 mmaaxx__ssiizzee
                        Optional. The maximum size in bytes of the data that can be captured from std‐
                        out. (Default: 16 MB.)

              The function returns a table as result with the following entries:

                 ssttaattuuss The raw exit status of the process. It will be negative on error.

                 ssttddoouutt Captured output stream as string, limited to mmaaxx__ssiizzee.

                 eerrrroorr  nniill on success. The string kkiilllleedd if the process was terminated in an  unusual
                        way. The string iinniitt if the process could not be started.

                        On Windows, kkiilllleedd is only returned when the process has been killed by mpv as
                        a result of ccaanncceellllaabbllee being set to ttrruuee.

                 kkiilllleedd__bbyy__uuss
                        Set to ttrruuee if the process has been killed by mpv as a result  of  ccaanncceellllaabbllee
                        being set to ttrruuee.

       uuttiillss..ssuubbpprroocceessss__ddeettaacchheedd((tt))
              Runs an external process and detaches it from mpv's control.

              The parameter tt is a table. The function reads the following entries:

                 aarrggss   Array  of  strings  of  the  same semantics as the aarrggss used in the ssuubbpprroocceessss
                        function.

              The function returns nniill.

       uuttiillss..ggeettppiidd(())
              Returns the process ID of the running mpv process. This can  be  used  to  identify  the
              calling mpv when launching (detached) subprocesses.

       uuttiillss..ppaarrssee__jjssoonn((ssttrr [[,, ttrraaiill]]))
              Parses  the  given  string  argument  as  JSON, and returns it as a Lua table. On error,
              returns nniill,, eerrrroorr. (Currently, eerrrroorr is just a string reading eerrrroorr, because  there  is
              no fine-grained error reporting of any kind.)

              The  returned  value uses similar conventions as mmpp..ggeett__pprrooppeerrttyy__nnaattiivvee(()) to distinguish
              empty objects and arrays.

              If the ttrraaiill parameter is ttrruuee (or any value equal to ttrruuee),  then  trailing  non-white‐
              space text is tolerated by the function, and the trailing text is returned as 3rd return
              value. (The 3rd return value is always there, but with ttrraaiill set, no error is raised.)

       uuttiillss..ffoorrmmaatt__jjssoonn((vv))
              Format the given Lua table (or value) as a JSON string and return it. On error,  returns
              nniill,, eerrrroorr. (Errors usually only happen on value types incompatible with JSON.)

              The  argument  value uses similar conventions as mmpp..sseett__pprrooppeerrttyy__nnaattiivvee(()) to distinguish
              empty objects and arrays.

       uuttiillss..ttoo__ssttrriinngg((vv))
              Turn the given value into a string. Formats tables and their contents. This  doesn't  do
              anything special; it is only needed because Lua is terrible.

   EEvveennttss
       Events  are  notifications  from player core to scripts. You can register an event handler with
       mmpp..rreeggiisstteerr__eevveenntt.

       Note that all scripts (and other parts of the player) receive events equally,  and  there's  no
       such thing as blocking other scripts from receiving events.

       Example:

          function my_fn(event)
              print("start of playback!")
          end

          mp.register_event("file-loaded", my_fn)

   LLiisstt ooff eevveennttss
       ssttaarrtt--ffiillee
              Happens  right before a new file is loaded. When you receive this, the player is loading
              the file (or possibly already done with it).

       eenndd--ffiillee
              Happens after a file was unloaded. Typically, the player will load the next  file  right
              away, or quit if this was the last file.

              The event has the rreeaassoonn field, which takes one of these values:

              eeooff    The  file  has  ended. This can (but doesn't have to) include incomplete files or
                     broken network connections under circumstances.

              ssttoopp   Playback was ended by a command.

              qquuiitt   Playback was ended by sending the quit command.

              eerrrroorr  An error happened. In this case, an eerrrroorr field is present with the error string.

              rreeddiirreecctt
                     Happens with playlists and similar. Details see  MMPPVV__EENNDD__FFIILLEE__RREEAASSOONN__RREEDDIIRREECCTT  in
                     the C API.

              uunnkknnoowwnn
                     Unknown.  Normally  doesn't  happen, unless the Lua API is out of sync with the C
                     API. (Likewise, it could happen that your script gets reason strings that did not
                     exist yet at the time your script was written.)

       ffiillee--llooaaddeedd
              Happens after a file was loaded and begins playback.

       sseeeekk   Happens  on  seeking.  (This  might include cases when the player seeks internally, even
              without user interaction. This includes e.g. segment changes when playing ordered  chap‐
              ters Matroska files.)

       ppllaayybbaacckk--rreessttaarrtt
              Start of playback after seek or after file was loaded.

       iiddllee   Idle  mode is entered. This happens when playback ended, and the player was started with
              ----iiddllee or ----ffoorrccee--wwiinnddooww. This mode is implicitly ended when the ssttaarrtt--ffiillee or  sshhuuttddoowwnn
              events happen.

       ttiicckk   Called after a video frame was displayed. This is a hack, and you should avoid using it.
              Use timers instead and maybe watch pausing/unpausing events to avoid  wasting  CPU  when
              the player is paused.

       sshhuuttddoowwnn
              Sent  when the player quits, and the script should terminate. Normally handled automati‐
              cally. See _D_e_t_a_i_l_s _o_n _t_h_e _s_c_r_i_p_t _i_n_i_t_i_a_l_i_z_a_t_i_o_n _a_n_d _l_i_f_e_c_y_c_l_e.

       lloogg--mmeessssaaggee
              Receives messages enabled with mmpp..eennaabbllee__mmeessssaaggeess. The message data is contained in  the
              table  passed  as first parameter to the event handler.  The table contains, in addition
              to the default event fields, the following fields:

              pprreeffiixx The module prefix, identifies the sender of the message. This is what the  termi‐
                     nal  player  puts  in front of the message text when using the ----vv option, and is
                     also what is used for ----mmssgg--lleevveell.

              lleevveell  The log level as string. See mmssgg..lloogg for possible log  level  names.   Note  that
                     later  versions  of  mpv  might  add new levels or remove (undocumented) existing
                     ones.

              tteexxtt   The log message. The text will end with a newline  character.  Sometimes  it  can
                     contain multiple lines.

              Keep  in mind that these messages are meant to be hints for humans. You should not parse
              them, and prefix/level/text of messages might change any time.

       ggeett--pprrooppeerrttyy--rreeppllyy

       vviiddeeoo--rreeccoonnffiigg

              Happens on audio output or filter reconfig.

       The following events also happen, but are deprecated:  ttrraacckkss--cchhaannggeedd,  ttrraacckk--sswwiittcchheedd,  ppaauussee,

              Add a hook callback for ttyyppee (a string identifying a certain kind of hook). These  hooks
              allow  the  player to call script functions and wait for their result (normally, the Lua
              scripting interface is asynchronous from the point of view of the player core). pprriioorriittyy
              is  an  arbitrary  integer  that allows ordering among hooks of the same kind. Using the
              value 50 is recommended as neutral default value. ffnn is the function that will be called
              during execution of the hook.

              See  _H_o_o_k_s  for currently existing hooks and what they do - only the hook list is inter‐
              esting; handling hook execution is done by the Lua script function automatically.

       JavaScript support in mpv is near identical to its Lua support. Use this section  as  reference
       on  differences  and availability of APIs, but otherwise you should refer to the Lua documenta‐
       tion for API details and general scripting in mpv.

       mpv tries to load a script file as JavaScript if it has a ..jjss  extension,  but  otherwise,  the
       documented Lua options, script directories, loading, etc apply to JavaScript files too.

       Script  initialization  and lifecycle is the same as with Lua, and most of the Lua functions at
       the modules mmpp, mmpp..uuttiillss, mmpp..mmssgg and mmpp..ooppttiioonnss are available to JavaScript with identical APIs
       -   including   running  commands,  getting/setting  properties,  registering  events/key-bind‐
       ings/hooks, etc.

   DDiiffffeerreenncceess ffrroomm LLuuaa
       No need to load modules. mmpp, mmpp..uuttiillss,  mmpp..mmssgg and mmpp..ooppttiioonnss are preloaded, and  you  can  use
       e.g. vvaarr ccwwdd == mmpp..uuttiillss..ggeettccwwdd(());; without prior setup.

       Errors  are  slightly  different.  Where the Lua APIs return nniill for error, the JavaScript ones
       return uunnddeeffiinneedd. Where Lua returns ssoommeetthhiinngg,, eerrrroorr JavaScript returns only  ssoommeetthhiinngg  -  and
       makes eerrrroorr available via mmpp..llaasstt__eerrrroorr(()). Note that only some of the functions have this addi‐
       tional eerrrroorr value - typically the same ones which have it in Lua.

       Standard APIs are preferred. For instance sseettTTiimmeeoouutt  and  JJSSOONN..ssttrriinnggiiffyy  are  available,  but
       mmpp..aadddd__ttiimmeeoouutt and mmpp..uuttiillss..ffoorrmmaatt__jjssoonn are not.

       No standard library. This means that interaction with anything outside of mpv is limited to the
       available APIs, typically via mmpp..uuttiillss. However, some file functions were added,  and  CommonJS
       rreeqquuiirree is available too - where the loaded modules have the same privileges as normal scripts.

       As such, SSttrriinngg..ssuubbssttrriinngg is implemented  for  instance,  while  the  common  but  non-standard

       sseettTTiimmeeoouutt and sseettIInntteerrvvaall return id, and later call ffnn (or execute ccooddee__ssttrriinngg) after dduurraattiioonn
       ms. Interval also repeat every dduurraattiioonn.

       dduurraattiioonn has a minimum and default value of 0, ccooddee__ssttrriinngg is a plain string which is evaluated
       as JS code, and [[,,aarrgg11 [[,,aarrgg22....]]]] are used as arguments (if provided) when calling back ffnn.

       The cclleeaarr......((iidd)) functions cancel timer iidd, and are irreversible.

       Note: timers always call back asynchronously, e.g. sseettTTiimmeeoouutt((ffnn)) will  never  call  ffnn  before
       returning. ffnn will be called either at the end of this event loop iteration or at a later event
       loop iteration. This is true also for intervals - which also never call back twice at the  same
       event loop iteration.

       Additionally,  timers  are  processed after the event queue is empty, so it's valid to use sseett‐‐
       TTiimmeeoouutt((ffnn)) as a one-time idle observer.

   CCoommmmoonnJJSS mmoodduulleess aanndd rreeqquuiirree((iidd))
       CommonJS Modules are a standard system where scripts can export common  functions  for  use  by
       other  scripts.  A  module  is a script which adds properties (functions, etc) to its invisible
       eexxppoorrttss object, which another script can access by loading it with rreeqquuiirree((mmoodduullee--iidd))  -  which
       returns that eexxppoorrttss object.

       Modules  and  rreeqquuiirree are supported, standard compliant, and generally similar to node.js. How‐
       ever, most node.js modules won't run due to missing modules such as ffss, pprroocceessss, etc, but  some
       node.js  modules with minimal dependencies do work. In general, this is for mpv modules and not
       a node.js replacement.

       A ..jjss file extension is always added to iidd, e.g. rreeqquuiirree((""..//ffoooo"")) will load the  file  ..//ffoooo..jjss
       and return its eexxppoorrttss object.

       An  id  is  relative (to the script which rreeqquuiirree'd it) if it starts with ..// or ....//. Otherwise,
       it's considered a "top-level id" (CommonJS term).

       Top level id is evaluated as absolute filesystem path if possible (e.g. //xx//yy  or  ~~//xx).  Other‐
       wise,  it's searched at ssccrriippttss//mmoodduulleess..jjss// in mpv config dirs - in normal config search order.
       E.g. rreeqquuiirree((""xx"")) is searched as file xx..jjss at those dirs, and id  ffoooo//xx  is  searched  as  file
       ffoooo//xx..jjss.

       No gglloobbaall variable, but a module's tthhiiss at its top lexical scope is the global object - also in
       strict mode. If you have a module which needs  gglloobbaall  as  the  global  object,  you  could  do
       tthhiiss..gglloobbaall == tthhiiss;; before rreeqquuiirree.

       Functions and variables declared at a module don't pollute the global object.

       The  event  loop poll/dispatch mpv events as long as the queue is not empty, then processes the
       timers, then waits for the next event, and repeats this forever.

       You could put this code at your script to replace the built-in event loop, and also print every
       event which mpv sends to your script:

          function mp_event_loop() {
              var wait = 0;
              do {
                  var e = mp.wait_event(wait);
                  dump(e);  // there could be a lot of prints...
                  if (e.event != "none") {
                      mp.dispatch_event(e);
                      wait = 0;
                  } else {
                      wait = mp.process_timers() / 1000;
                      if (wait != 0) {
                          mp.notify_idle_observers();
                          wait = mp.peek_timers_wait() / 1000;
                      }
                  }
              } while (mp.keep_running);
          }

       mmpp__eevveenntt__lloooopp is a name which mpv tries to call after the script loads.  The internal implemen‐
       tation is similar to this (without dduummpp though..).

       ee == mmpp..wwaaiitt__eevveenntt((wwaaiitt)) returns when the next mpv event arrives, or after wwaaiitt seconds if posi‐
       tive  and no mpv events arrived. wwaaiitt value of 0 returns immediately (with ee..eevveenntt ==== ""nnoonnee"" if
       the queue is empty).

       mmpp..ddiissppaattcchh__eevveenntt((ee)) calls back the handlers registered for ee..eevveenntt, if there are  such  (event
       handlers, property observers, script messages, etc).

       mmpp..pprroocceessss__ttiimmeerrss(())  calls  back  the  already-added,  non-canceled due timers, and returns the
       duration in ms till the next due timer (possibly 0), or -1 if there are no pending timers. Must
       not be called recursively.

       mmpp..nnoottiiffyy__iiddllee__oobbsseerrvveerrss(()) calls back the idle observers, which we do when we're about to sleep
       (wait != 0), but the observers may add timers or take non-negligible duration to  complete,  so
       we re-calculate wwaaiitt afterwards.

       mmpp..ppeeeekk__ttiimmeerrss__wwaaiitt(())  returns  the  same  values as mmpp..pprroocceessss__ttiimmeerrss(()) but without doing any‐
       thing. Invalid result if called from a timer callback.

       Note: eexxiitt(()) is also registered for the sshhuuttddoowwnn event, and  its  implementation  is  a  simple

JJSSOONN IIPPCC
       mpv  can  be  controlled  by  external  programs  using the JSON-based IPC protocol.  It can be
       enabled  by  specifying  the  path  to  a  unix  socket  or  a  named  pipe  using  the  option
       ----iinnppuutt--iippcc--sseerrvveerr.  Clients  can  connect  to  this  socket and send commands to the player or
       receive events from it.

       WWAARRNNIINNGG::
          This is not intended to be a secure network protocol. It is explicitly insecure: there is no
          authentication,  no  encryption,  and the commands themselves are insecure too. For example,
          the rruunn command is exposed, which can run arbitrary system commands. The  use-case  is  con‐
          trolling the player locally. This is not different from the MPlayer slave protocol.

   SSooccaatt eexxaammppllee
       You  can use the ssooccaatt tool to send commands (and receive replies) from the shell. Assuming mpv
       was started with:

          mpv file.mkv --input-ipc-server=/tmp/mpvsocket

       Then you can control it using socat:

          > echo '{ "command": ["get_property", "playback-time"] }' | socat - /tmp/mpvsocket
          {"data":190.482000,"error":"success"}

       In this case, socat copies data between stdin/stdout and the mpv socket connection.

       See the ----iiddllee option how to make mpv start without exiting immediately or playing a file.

       It's also possible to send input.conf style text-only commands:

          > echo 'show-text ${playback-time}' | socat - /tmp/mpvsocket

       But you won't get a reply over the socket. (This particular command shows the playback time  on
       the player's OSD.)

   CCoommmmaanndd PPrroommpptt eexxaammppllee
       Unfortunately,  it's  not  as  easy to test the IPC protocol on Windows, since Windows ports of
       socat (in Cygwin and MSYS2) don't understand named pipes. In the absence of a  simple  tool  to
       send  and  receive from bidirectional pipes, the eecchhoo command can be used to send commands, but
       not receive replies from the command prompt.

       Assuming mpv was started with:

          mpv file.mkv --input-ipc-server=\\.\pipe\mpvsocket

       You can send commands from a command prompt:

          echo show-text ${playback-time} >\\.\pipe\mpvsocket

       To be able to simultaneously read and write from the IPC pipe, like on Linux, it's necessary to
       write  an  external  program  that uses overlapped file I/O (or some wrapper like .NET's Named‐
       PipeClientStream.)

   PPrroottooccooll
       Clients can execute commands on the player by sending JSON messages of the following form:

          { "command": ["command_name", "param1", "param2", ...] }

       where ccoommmmaanndd__nnaammee is the name of the command to be executed, followed by a list of parameters.
       Parameters  must  be  formatted as native JSON values (integers, strings, booleans, ...). Every
       message mmuusstt be terminated with \\nn. Additionally, \\nn must not appear anywhere inside  the  mes‐
       sage. In practice this means that messages should be minified before being sent to mpv.

       mpv  will then send back a reply indicating whether the command was run correctly, and an addi‐
       tional field holding the command-specific return data (it can also be null).

          { "error": "success", "data": null }

       mpv will also send events to clients with JSON messages of the following form:

          { "event": "event_name" }

       where eevveenntt__nnaammee is the name of  the  event.  Additional  event-specific  fields  can  also  be
       present. See _L_i_s_t _o_f _e_v_e_n_t_s for a list of all supported events.

       Because  events can occur at any time, it may be difficult at times to determine which response
       goes with which command. Commands may optionally include a rreeqquueesstt__iidd which, if provided in the
       command  request,  will  be  copied  verbatim  into  the  response.  mpv does not intrepret the
       rreeqquueesstt__iidd in any way; it is solely for the use of the requester.

       For example, this request:

          { "command": ["get_property", "time-pos"], "request_id": 100 }

       Would generate this response:

          { "error": "success", "data": 1.468135, "request_id": 100 }

       All commands, replies, and events are separated from each other with  a  line  break  character
       (\\nn).

       If the first character (after skipping whitespace) is not {{, the command will be interpreted as
       non-JSON text command, as they are used in input.conf (or mmppvv__ccoommmmaanndd__ssttrriinngg(())  in  the  client
       API). Additionally, lines starting with ## and empty lines are ignored.

       Currently, embedded 0 bytes terminate the current line, but you should not rely on this.

   CCoommmmaannddss
       In  addition to the commands described in _L_i_s_t _o_f _I_n_p_u_t _C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s, a few extra commands can also
       be used as part of the protocol:

       cclliieenntt__nnaammee
              Return the name of the client as string. This is the string iippcc--NN with N being an  inte‐
              ger number.

       ggeett__ttiimmee__uuss
              Return  the current mpv internal time in microseconds as a number. This is basically the
              system time, with an arbitrary offset.

       ggeett__pprrooppeerrttyy
              Return the value of the given property. The value will be sent in the data field of  the
              replay message.

              Example:

                 { "command": ["get_property", "volume"] }
                 { "data": 50.0, "error": "success" }

       ggeett__pprrooppeerrttyy__ssttrriinngg
              Like ggeett__pprrooppeerrttyy, but the resulting data will always be a string.

              Example:

                 { "command": ["get_property_string", "volume"] }
                 { "data": "50.000000", "error": "success" }

       sseett__pprrooppeerrttyy
              Set  the  given  property  to the given value. See _P_r_o_p_e_r_t_i_e_s for more information about
              properties.

              Example:

                 { "command": ["set_property", "pause", true] }
                 { "error": "success" }

       sseett__pprrooppeerrttyy__ssttrriinngg
              Alias for sseett__pprrooppeerrttyy. Both commands accept native values and strings.

       oobbsseerrvvee__pprrooppeerrttyy
              Watch a property for changes. If the given property is changed, then an  event  of  type
              pprrooppeerrttyy--cchhaannggee will be generated

              Example:

                 { "command": ["observe_property", 1, "volume"] }
                 { "error": "success" }
                 { "event": "property-change", "id": 1, "data": 52.0, "name": "volume" }

              WWAARRNNIINNGG::
                 If the connection is closed, the IPC client is destroyed internally, and the observed
                 properties are unregistered. This happens for example  when  sending  commands  to  a
                 socket with separate ssooccaatt invocations.  This can make it seem like property observa‐
                 tion does not work. You must keep the IPC connection open to make it work.

       oobbsseerrvvee__pprrooppeerrttyy__ssttrriinngg
              Like oobbsseerrvvee__pprrooppeerrttyy, but the resulting data will always be a string.

              Example:

                 { "command": ["observe_property_string", 1, "volume"] }
                 { "error": "success" }
                 { "event": "property-change", "id": 1, "data": "52.000000", "name": "volume" }

       uunnoobbsseerrvvee__pprrooppeerrttyy

              the observed command as argument.

              Example:

                 { "command": ["unobserve_property", 1] }
                 { "error": "success" }

       rreeqquueesstt__lloogg__mmeessssaaggeess
              Enable  output  of  mpv  log messages. They will be received as events. The parameter to
              this command is the log-level (see mmppvv__rreeqquueesstt__lloogg__mmeessssaaggeess C API function).

              Log message output is meant for humans  only  (mostly  for  debugging).   Attempting  to
              retrieve  information  by parsing these messages will just lead to breakages with future
              mpv releases. Instead, make a feature request, and ask for a proper event  that  returns
              the information you need.

              the string aallll is used instead of an event name, all events are enabled or disabled.

              By default, most events are enabled, and there is not much use for this command.

   UUTTFF--88
       Normally, all strings are in UTF-8. Sometimes it can happen that strings  are  in  some  broken
       encoding  (often happens with file tags and such, and filenames on many Unixes are not required
       to be in UTF-8 either). This means that mpv sometimes sends invalid JSON. If that is a  problem
       for  the client application's parser, it should filter the raw data for invalid UTF-8 sequences
       and perform the desired replacement, before feeding the data to its JSON parser.

       mpv will not attempt to construct invalid UTF-8 with broken escape sequences.

       mpv can be embedded into other programs as video/audio playback backend. The recommended way to
       do so is using libmpv. See lliibbmmppvv//cclliieenntt..hh in the mpv source code repository. This provides a C
       API. Bindings for other languages might be available (see wiki).

       Since  libmpv merely allows access to underlying mechanisms that can control mpv, further docu‐
       mentation is spread over a few places:

CC PPLLUUGGIINNSS
       You can write C plugins for mpv. These use the libmpv API, although they do not use the  libmpv
       library itself.

       Currently,  they  must  be  explicitly  enabled  at build time with ----eennaabbllee--ccpplluuggiinnss. They are
       available on Linux/BSD platforms only.

   CC pplluuggiinnss llooccaattiioonn
       C plugins are put into the mpv scripts directory in its config directory (see the _F_I_L_E_S section
       for details). They must have a ..ssoo file extension.  They can also be explicitly loaded with the
       ----ssccrriipptt option.

   AAPPII
       A C plugin must export the following function:

          int mpv_open_cplugin(mpv_handle *handle)

       The plugin function will be called on loading time. This function does not return  as  long  as
       your  plugin  is  loaded (it runs in its own thread). The hhaannddllee will be deallocated as soon as
       the plugin function returns.

       The return value is interpreted as error status. A value of 00 is interpreted as success,  while
       --11  signals an error. In the latter case, the player prints an uninformative error message that
       loading failed.

       Return values other than 00 and --11 are reserved, and trigger undefined behavior.

       Within the plugin function, you can call  libmpv  API  functions.  The  hhaannddllee  is  created  by
       mmppvv__ccrreeaattee__cclliieenntt(())  (or  actually  an  internal  equivalent), and belongs to you. You can call
       mmppvv__wwaaiitt__eevveenntt(()) to wait for things happening, and so on.

       Note that the player might block until your plugin calls mmppvv__wwaaiitt__eevveenntt(()) for the  first  time.
       This gives you a chance to install initial hooks etc.  before playback begins.

       The details are quite similar to Lua scripts.

   LLiinnkkaaggee ttoo lliibbmmppvv
       The  current implementation requires that your plugins are nnoott linked against libmpv. What your
       plugins uses are not symbols from a libmpv binary, but symbols from the mpv host binary.

       There are a number of environment variables that can be used to control the behavior of mpv.

       HHOOMMEE,, XXDDGG__CCOONNFFIIGG__HHOOMMEE
              Used to determine mpv config directory. If XXDDGG__CCOONNFFIIGG__HHOOMMEE is not set, $$HHOOMMEE//..ccoonnffiigg//mmppvv
              is used.

              $$HHOOMMEE//..mmppvv is always added to the list of config search paths with a lower priority.

       XXDDGG__CCOONNFFIIGG__DDIIRRSS
              If set, XDG-style system configuration directories are used. Otherwise, the UNIX conven‐
              tion (PPRREEFFIIXX//eettcc//mmppvv//) is used.

       MMPPVV__HHOOMMEE
              Directory where mpv looks for user settings. Overrides HHOOMMEE, and mpv will  try  to  load
              the config file as $$MMPPVV__HHOOMMEE//mmppvv..ccoonnff.

       MMPPVV__VVEERRBBOOSSEE ((sseeee aallssoo --vv aanndd ----mmssgg--lleevveell))
              Set  the  initial  verbosity  level across all message modules (default: 0).  This is an
              integer, and the resulting verbosity corresponds to the number of ----vv options passed  to
              the command line.

       MMPPVV__LLEEAAKK__RREEPPOORRTT

       lliibbddvvddccssss::

              DDVVDDCCSSSS__CCAACCHHEE
                     Specify a directory in which to store  title  key  values.  This  will  speed  up
                     descrambling  of  DVDs which are in the cache. The DDVVDDCCSSSS__CCAACCHHEE directory is cre‐
                     ated if it does not exist, and a subdirectory is created named  after  the  DVD's
                     title  or  manufacturing  date. If DDVVDDCCSSSS__CCAACCHHEE is not set or is empty, libdvdcss
                     will use the default value which is $${{HHOOMMEE}}//..ddvvddccssss// under Unix and  the  roaming
                     application  data  directory  (%%AAPPPPDDAATTAA%%)  under Windows. The special value "off"
                     disables caching.

              DDVVDDCCSSSS__MMEETTHHOODD
                     Sets the authentication and decryption method that libdvdcss  will  use  to  read
                     scrambled discs. Can be one of ttiittllee, kkeeyy or ddiisscc.

                     kkeeyy    is  the default method. libdvdcss will use a set of calculated player keys
                            to try to get the disc key. This can fail if the drive does not  recognize
                            any of the player keys.

                     ddiisscc   is  a  fallback  method when key has failed. Instead of using player keys,
                            libdvdcss will crack the disc key using  a  brute  force  algorithm.  This
                            process  is  CPU intensive and requires 64 MB of memory to store temporary
                            data.

                     ttiittllee  is the fallback when all other methods have failed. It does not rely on  a
                            key  exchange with the DVD drive, but rather uses a crypto attack to guess
                            the title key. On rare cases this may fail because  there  is  not  enough
                            encrypted  data  on  the  disc to perform a statistical attack, but on the
                            other hand it is the only way to decrypt a DVD stored on a hard disc, or a
                            DVD with the wrong region on an RPC2 drive.

              DDVVDDCCSSSS__RRAAWW__DDEEVVIICCEE
                     Specify  the raw device to use. Exact usage will depend on your operating system,
                     the Linux utility to set up raw devices is raw(8) for instance. Please note  that
                     on  most  operating  systems, using a raw device requires highly aligned buffers:
                     Linux requires a 2048 bytes alignment (which is the size of a DVD sector).

       Normally mmppvv returns 0 as exit code after finishing playback successfully.  If  errors  happen,
       the following exit codes can be returned:

          11      Error initializing mpv. This is also returned if unknown options are passed to mpv.

          22      The  file  passed to mpv couldn't be played. This is somewhat fuzzy: currently, play‐
                 back of a file is considered to be successful if initialization was  mostly  success‐
                 ful, even if playback fails immediately after initialization.

          33      There  were some files that could be played, and some files which couldn't (using the
                 definition of success from above).

          44      Quit due to a signal, Ctrl+c in a VO window (by default), or from  the  default  quit
                 key bindings in encoding mode.

       Note  that  quitting  the  player manually will always lead to exit code 0, overriding the exit
       code that would be returned normally. Also, the qquuiitt input command can take an  exit  code:  in
       this case, that exit code is returned.

              Each file is a small config file which is loaded if  the  corresponding  media  file  is

       ferent.  They are generally located under %%AAPPPPDDAATTAA%%//mmppvv//.  For example, the path to mpv.conf is
       %%AAPPPPDDAATTAA%%//mmppvv//mmppvv..ccoonnff, which maps to a system and user-specific path, for example
          CC::\\uusseerrss\\UUSSEERRNNAAMMEE\\AAppppDDaattaa\\RRooaammiinngg\\mmppvv\\mmppvv..ccoonnff

       You can find the exact path by running eecchhoo %%AAPPPPDDAATTAA%%\\mmppvv\\mmppvv..ccoonnff in cmd.exe.

       Other config files (such as iinnppuutt..ccoonnff) are in the same directory. See the _F_I_L_E_S section above.

       The environment variable $$MMPPVV__HHOOMMEE completely overrides these, like on UNIX.

       If a directory named ppoorrttaabbllee__ccoonnffiigg next to the mpv.exe exists, all config will be loaded from
       this  directory  only.  Watch  later  config files are written to this directory as well. (This
       exists on Windows only and is redundant with $$MMPPVV__HHOOMMEE. However, since Windows is very  script‐
       ing unfriendly, a wrapper script just setting $$MMPPVV__HHOOMMEE, like you could do it on other systems,
       won't work. ppoorrttaabbllee__ccoonnffiigg is provided for convenience to get around this restriction.)

       Config files located in the same directory as mmppvv..eexxee are loaded with lower priority. Some con‐
       fig files are loaded only once, which means that e.g. of 2 iinnppuutt..ccoonnff files located in two con‐
       fig directories, only the one from the directory with higher priority will be loaded.

       A third config directory with the lowest priority is the directory named mmppvv in the same direc‐
       tory  as  mmppvv..eexxee. This used to be the directory with the highest priority, but is now discour‐
       aged to use and might be removed in the future.

       Note that mpv likes to mix // and \\ path separators for simplicity.  kernel32.dll accepts  this,
       but cmd.exe does not.
